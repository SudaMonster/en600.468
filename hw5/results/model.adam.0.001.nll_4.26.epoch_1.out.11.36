Obama is asking Netanyahu .
least between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly @-@ fetched .
talk to the implementation of the international agreement , and on the Middle East &apos;s efforts to be agreed on the implementation of the international agreement .
but it is said to be said to be a conflict in which the Palestinian conflict and the discussed two - the states - is turning to the rescue of the Americas .
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu .
sustained Israel is critical of ongoing settlement building Israel , and does Netanyahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
the deal with the deal surrounding Iran &apos;s nuclear program has worsened the two further the relationship of the two .
in March , Netanyahu had been aimed at invitation to the US Republican Party , the Congress Congress held a disputed speech , which was regarded as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not met with Obama , a meeting that has been rejected by the upcoming election in Israel .
an emergency call for his friend to have shot up to his friend .
in a emergency call , professor Sh@@ F@@ on Lam@@ b , with a somewhat z@@ ci@@ ous voice of the police , told him his friend shot and that his house would have to come to his house .
we could be found in a hand@@ y , &quot; he said that family marriage could be found in a hand@@ y .
within the house , officials found the ser@@ y p@@ ren@@ ti@@ t , and a hand@@ d note that was a white bloc : Mi@@ r , who was a white bloc , was to be und@@ ed on a white bloc : Mi@@ r is so tired I wanted to do it : and , according to the authorities , I have ever signed me .
there was no indication that Lam@@ b , who is in two online , is already sl@@ pped to the delta State University in C@@ le@@ <unk> and , Mis@@ si@@ ssi@@ i , and , in the case of a popular history , E@@ as@@ a , where he has been asked by the police , and killed the door to his office .
the E@@ E University of State , J@@ ford said that the university of the university - the shooting 10 @-@ clock - is the ones .
he said that Lam@@ b has made the disastrous emergency story to be made .
by the end of the day , there was another death : lam@@ m took him when the police denied him .
a day after the shooting at the University , students and D@@ oc@@ ators , forced to hide behind closed doors , try to hide an image of what the lam@@ b were motivated .
the details of both the state &apos;s subjects , as was what students and staff who knew him , helped , helped to be an image of a talented but possibly difficult teachers .
turned to his teaching .
the police in the streets , where p@@ ren@@ ti@@ died died , said that he has no history of violence or a criminal history .
a &quot; mentioned &quot; he has mentioned a book in a man @-@ made book he has told the &quot; wonderful people ; &quot; he said he shared his academic life .
both under@@ educated in the Department of social sciences and history , whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students visited their students .
too , some tendencies have been made to problematic mental behavior .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ a , who praised the lam@@ b , said that he seemed to be a little and nervous about whether something wrong is wrong .
another student , S@@ el Sy@@ ke , said that Lam@@ m told him that he had been the end of the academic year of 2014 - to do with stress .
Lam@@ b had asked the delta State University to provide a &quot; drain on health grounds , saying that he had some health problem .
little just put two online in this year - the world &apos;s top prices .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policies meant that the pro@@ co@@ lity that had worked so hard for the lam@@ b , for him , would be a professor for him a automatic path to a job of the kind of being an additional effort .
in the meantime , the President William For@@ te said that he wi@@ ars nothing from a conflict between Lam@@ b and Schmidt , but , of course , there was something in a British Lam@@ b .
thing questions &quot; can be answered .
after the flight , the police found Lam@@ ls later when he was re@@ can@@ ing in Mis@@ si@@ ssi@@ i of Ar@@ can@@ on .
before he could be arrested , Lam@@ b murdered himself with a car@@ le south of his home house , a series of the town of Gre@@ K@@ lle , said , Washington Coun@@ ty Cor@@ z@@ methane .
his car was still in one of travel .
it was not immediately clear why Lam@@ b was going to this house , but Johnson said that they knew people who lived there .
Lam@@ b grew in the area .
Lam@@ b began his work at the University , which 3,@@ 3,@@ 500 students in a city with roughly 1@@ 2,000 people , and under@@ directed geography and educ@@ ators .
he was in P@@ ago@@ gi@@ k .
of the long @-@ time girl@@ friends of Zimbabwe called him as smart , charismatic , and in@@ al@@ ance .
Car@@ la H@@ dou@@ ston said she was 15 and lam@@ m , when they met with common friends .
she and their friends were in high school school , and he was the co@@ ole older Ker@@ l who tried to bring back to the bars .
he was the female black back then .
all girls were then going to be when he was , and , now , 40 and now in the West &apos;s town of Brand@@ on a bloody surface .
obviously have been a case of time and p@@ ren@@ ti@@ s .
in the emergency call Lam@@ b &amp; nbsp ; I have killed my wife ; but there was no ancient public marriage .
they had a dog called Li@@ gh@@ a , who lived with them in the B@@ aven@@ stone &apos;s name , a house who has been drawn to a Ba@@ beat in a hur@@ beat .
in order was the dog .
ren@@ , the former &apos;s chief of the former - the E@@ ren@@ ti@@ s@@ s@@ son , Sha@@ W@@ O &amp; nbsp ; St@@ eums , said that she had been detained 15 years ago , but friends had remained friends and a daughter who was now 19 years old .
it was not a mistake for you ; you had been destroyed on the ground ; the St@@ eums said of his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &amp; # 160 ; St@@ ew said that he never met lam@@ b , but he was he heard that Lam@@ b was interested in music and blu@@ la@@ es .
Lam@@ b hit p@@ ren@@ ti@@ ang , when he and A@@ bi@@ g@@ a three years ago , each in a summer of around the world .
later , they played a way or another .
we have been saying his daughter , she said his own music .
P@@ ren@@ ti@@ &apos;s was a nurses in which various companies are online online .
Mike Sh@@ aff@@ er , a B@@ ark@@ e@@ man , and sometimes under@@ @-@ handed power - the emergence of the National <unk> on Ro@@ om , a weak b@@ ar in the night 5 , said that he had ended the last time , after Lam@@ b finished his bars and word , a wealthy audience .
there was no sign that something did not .
&quot; only a lucky couple said .
and so@@ bed each other .
I think they had good sense for their own .

To@@ ley &apos;s R @-@ fund plans to stop less workers for the Christmas days of Christmas time .

the Pre@@ mi@@ er of the game was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
I are , in the theater , the Royal &apos;s own life on Royal &apos;s , and I realize that the seat is empty , and it is beginning to be clear that the seat is empty , and it is beginning to be clear that the seat is empty , and it is beginning to be clear that the next @-@ seat stay , he said , he said that the next @-@ seat stay , he said ,

the &quot; reset &quot; in a number of cin@@ os is being seen in a hur@@ cin@@ ry , D@@ VD , and in a host movie .
that there is no military solution in Syria in Syria .
Secretary @-@ General Ban Ki @-@ bak - The saying says that his response to Russia &apos;s enhanced military support for Syria is : there is no military solution ; the nearly five years of conflict , and more weapons will only make violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN is asking - the head of the UN - the Security Council , which is calling to unite and inclusive negotiations to the Fin@@ ve of a political solution .
ban , a press conference on the Middle East , was planning to be planning to meet the foreign minister of the Commission - the United States , Russia , China , the United Kingdom , and France - on the verge of the General Assembly , the United States , and France , to discuss the situation in Syria .
he has been biased that the divisions of the Council and the regional powers are being able to do so .
ban has called for the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity that have demonstrated them with Iran in reaching a nuclear deal with Iran .
we are taking on the fact that Donald t@@ der is serious .
to be mentioned .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
panic wait to collapse .
but , however some Republicans try to draw Donald t@@ der from the top , there is no work .
ten of the last 11 national surveys showed Donald t@@ sis in double @-@ digit terms , and some begin to ask seriously what it is in the real estate &apos;s chances of the real estate &apos;s nomination - the Mo@@ ok@@ ary .
we are too early in the election &quot; is too early in the election .
nobody claims that , most likely , the Republican nomination will likely win .
experts stress that when the P@@ ain had been put at the rising C@@ ain in 2011 , the world &apos;s Nobel C@@ ain was issued by the rising C@@ ain , which no one state in the process of nomin@@ ating .
there are many reasons to fight in a general election .
but outsiders like Jean @-@ Bush &apos;s super @-@ Sup@@ k PA@@ C and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognize the road for Growth and start to overthrow their dollar to topple it .
here are some current survey ratings suggest that real estate is not only a temporary phase : the natural Mo@@ l is not only a temporary period :
180 degrees has been around .
shortly before Donald President Donald his candidacy announced in mid @-@ June , a poll by Mon@@ ol was a conclusion of the Mon@@ ol - the University of the German standard that only two of ten Republicans were the real estate - the Mo@@ gu@@ l &apos;s real estate .
by mid @-@ July , it was 40 % .
52 % were 52 % in early August .
has been a positive view of Donald ales .
10 @-@ 10 % say that they have a negative opinion .
the numbers .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ c of a State vote in Iowa last week found that 60 % of Republicans have a good say .
two @-@ thirds of the G@@ O@@ P - the G@@ O@@ P would be happy with t@@ t@@ ty than candidates .
the United Kingdom &apos;s projected 67 % of Republicans , they were either a &quot; co@@ ck , &quot; or &quot; ; &quot; if a threat @-@ by @-@ board @-@ to @-@ be , would be a &quot; red &quot; ;
only two of 10 say they would be angry ; if he were the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son creates roughly the same enthusiasm as the equivalent of the divide ( 43 % say , they were &quot; with &quot; - and are enthusiastic of 40 % that the same goes above a more recent @-@ to @-@ trade ) .
the next thing in enthusiasm ?
start &quot; with only 21 % .
on the other hand , 47 % of Republican voters say they are being unhappy ; and if it was the case , the candidate would be , if Y@@ b Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be a candidate .
a majority of the Republicans are facing a lot of temper@@ ament .
while Donald widespread evidence is widely criticized for his grandiose and offensive statements , 52 % of Irish voters who have criticized the real estate of the real estate , the real estate of Irish voters , the right temper@@ ament for a president , has been the right temper@@ ament for a president , so A@@ BC News / Washington Post on Mon@@ day .
the same number is true in the first dis@@ discrimin@@ nation state of the nation , the state of state , where the same 52 % of Republicans think that he has a role for a command , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ k , week .
still , 44 % think that he has not been the figure to carry out effective power , and almost six out 10 % say that his temper@@ ament does not go into the White House , so A@@ BC / Post .
Republican voters get accustomed to the idea .
Republican voters are putting a lot of real estate when they put their own to their own .
if they are asked who is the most likely the G@@ O@@ P , the nomination wins , according to a BBC / F@@ C poll on the past week , the world &apos;s a poll of CNN / F@@ C , four from 10 , that the best bet is to be found .
this is a change since the time when four of 10 ended in July , when four of 10 ended their money on a mere Bush .
full disclosure : G@@ O@@ P - the eurozone &apos;s most clearly is the clearest crystal ball in the past .
at this point , four of ten Republicans thought that the nomination would win the nomination only 28 % for the final candidate Mitt Romney .
yet , in the case , a number of G@@ O@@ P is showing that a number of G@@ O@@ P is a plausible view .
when Republicans are mounting to impose a different candidate .
some experts suggest that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to a strong @-@ profile role , while the anti @-@ Americanism - the threat of the Americas - is a more common @-@ dozen &quot; than a dozen other candidates . &quot;
in early September , a poll on the ground - the contest between the creation and most other Republican candidates , a joint head - is a fa@@ wn of support .
he has made 13 points before the C@@ min@@ Fi@@ ina , a 13 @-@ looking point before Mar@@ co @-@ century @-@ 15 items , 19 points , and , finally , Paul , John Yor@@ e , and Chris .
it is an head of the game - the head of the world - to get its head around - the head of the game with T@@ C@@ z C@@ ru@@ z .
the only candidate that suggests him ?
Ben Car@@ son would make the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head - the contest of the Americas - to make the race .
a near @-@ time majority of Donald challenges - the threat of widespread - is the threat of their opinion .
a new poll by CB@@ S / N@@ Y@@ T on the service of the service shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support the st@@ st@@ ure say that they have their votes .
to be sure , much has happened to change this , and nobody can never say that it never to change .
46 % said that they are open to take the door to other candidates .
but the strongest competition in the moment of the other outsider , the neur@@ och@@ ent Ben Car@@ son , who say that they have formed their opinion , are twice that of a lot of the story .
related to be connected with a related @-@ related @-@ trade issue .
since Donald t@@ der in his campaign campaign had been in his campaign for months of Mexico , the immigration was the &quot; rap@@ ness in public discourse . &quot;
some worry that , by the Republican Party , the bomb @-@ minded out@@ be able to be removed by the Republican Party and the new resistance - the country &apos;s efforts to change .
but , after the new A@@ BC / Post , six of 10 Republicans say that they are closely tied to the issue of immigration .
control migration in the spotlight , however , it seems to be doing .
.
in fact , Donald Car@@ son &apos;s support , and , above all , is now about half of the support of Republican voters , especially through their outsiders - is the status .
six from 10 Republicans say in the new mon@@ day - the main survey of A@@ BC / Post , they prefer to prefer a political maver@@ ick than someone with government experience .
they are angry to Washington .
a poll of D@@ <unk> &apos;s Day / Bloomberg in two weeks ago shows that three of four &apos;s state - Republican Republicans in Congress are frustrated by 54 % - are dissatisfied , and 21 % , and 21 % , with the highest @-@ rate ; &quot; I go back . &quot;

to be used to resolve the dispute over the proposed transatlantic Free Trade Agreement T@@ T@@ an , the EU has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ atory system .
the disputed private arbit@@ lement facilities are designed to be replaced by a more transparent system in which it is done in its functioning of the traditional courts in its functioning .
what we want to be a system that citizens trusted is the EU &apos;s &quot; Yes &quot; - the EU &apos;s rotating Commissioner - the European Union , the European Union , has declared the idea of European Commissioner , the European Union , the European Union , the European Union , Com@@ Commissioner C@@ ec@@ i@@ e Mal@@ m@@ m .

the German government announced support .
is to be the world &apos;s largest free area .
the plans to reform the current refer@@ procedure , however , face that the EU is making the idea - the United States and the US jointly jointly choose for a new investment court .
it is meant to be equal to the same parts of the EU , the US , and from third states .
for the first time .
it would allow to impose the verdicts .
so far , the rules involved to referee among referee , a self @-@ compliance of their judgments , has been so far agreed .
the recent months has been clear that citizens have not trusted the old @-@ style @-@ all @-@ all @-@ all @-@ all @-@ all @-@ all @-@ all @-@ sense system - the system of fairness and justice in the recent months .

since his election , the Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ yn@@ s &apos;s De@@ ve is expected to be the Fra@@ ch of Prime Minister , with tension , with tension .
the new Labour , the head of the new Labour , is supposed to be the c@@ arer of prime minister , and then to make David Cameron at the first time when David Cameron took .
but , shortly after a day , it will be a tax to ask the first of his six @-@ first set on the day , with his performance of the media and the Labour - and the Labour - to attract the Labour - will be headed by the proximity .

nearly a dozen of shadow - the United States &apos;s top team refused to serve in a scientist Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s &apos;s top team , and they are calling for differences in the economy , defense , and foreign policy , while less than one @-@ sixth of the Parli@@ ament@@ Party &apos;s parliamentary Party initially supported him as a leader .
the political cor@@ respondents at the BBC &apos;s Tari@@ ac@@ c@@ ic cor@@ respondents , says that political differences are also coming within Labour , and , according to the S@@ ann@@ yn@@ yn@@ t , the position for the European Union and limit on profits .
as Cor@@ B@@ n said the T@@ UC , the T@@ UC is showing that Labour changes to care to remove the whole idea of a limit .
hours later , the shadow of the country , the shadow of the country - the job of labor and pensions - the party &apos;s ability to intervene , is a very clear case that they are only against the government plans to cut limiting 2@@ 6,000 of 2@@ 6,000 of 2@@ 3,000 .
as N@@ B@@ n will be the fifth Labour , the fifth Labour is the head of Labour , David Cameron , who has since he is a leader in the last decade about the dispute , the last decade of the presidential struggle .

the Is@@ ady ton of Is@@ e@@ ton has said that the fragility of the prime minister is too present , and that he will be judged with dissent and , instead , to focus on serious problems like poverty , inequality , and challenges for young people .
but , while cor@@ B@@ n has said that , as his country is not included , the shadow of the presidency is represented in him , for example , when Mr. Cameron is on the way .
he also has said the idea that other colleagues occasionally occasionally take the word , and that he has been watching John Ber@@ ger , the speaker of the House of the lower house , to discuss the problem .
when he became leader in 2005 , Cameron Cameron said that he was a policy @-@ style approach to a &quot; red @-@ thro@@ ning &quot; - the cur@@ ing of the prime minister &apos;s political style , but some years later , he said that he failed .
since it was awarded first in 1990 , the Fra@@ ship was seen as the main bar@@ ometer of the ruling of a leader and his leadership in the House of a leader and his position under his parliament , although critics have argued that they had become a caric@@ ature and needed reforms .

former US , for Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , continues to keep a double @-@ digit margin in the democratic race to the national nomination , but Senator Ber@@ never &apos;s , no other than the ground is gaining ground .
Clinton has now received support from 47 % of democratic voters in the primary ( 58 % ) , while S@@ different is second in second , with 27 % ( rising by 17 % ) .
vice President Joe Biden , who has not yet announced whether he is running for the presidency , receives support from 15 % of the Democratic electorate .
more than five months before the start of the primary spot , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinions is what will be the candidates .
he &apos;s supporters of the other candidates are more permanent than those of the other candidates .
since the CB@@ S has been asking - the News News - the Clinton survey has lost Clinton on a number of demographic groups , while S@@ different gains have been in a series of profits .
Clinton holds a large margin in women and moderates , but that anticipation of those who have been reduced .
clearly , with the men , much , and S@@ different is back to 5 points .
the benefit of democratic voters in 50 years has evap@@ orated , and they are now equal to the same level .
voters .
last month , Clinton was head @-@ à @-@ vis @-@ two @-@ presidential advantage in liberals , but S@@ different has now turned a 5 @-@ month call - the head of the group .
for example , half of the democratic electorate of the primary nationwide vote say that they would support with enthusiasm Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some cav@@ eats and another 15 % would only support them because they are the candidate .
six % would not support them .
now is not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are above all .
views are more likely to support the views of those who currently support Clinton - only about a quarter , for example - only about a quarter .
while 48 % of the Democratic electorate say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , fewer Republican voters say that they are now a prime @-@ candidate candidate , Donald <unk> ( 35 % ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question , why are they to say why they want a woman is the most common answer that it is time to be a woman ( 13 % ) , and that it is the best candidate for the job ( 10 % ) .
the Clinton &apos;s supporters , too , is mentioned with Bill Clinton ( 9 % ) .
allocation are dealing with problems and the di@@ titude .
since the president is running a potential for the presidency in the B@@ ag@@ l , 57 % of the Democratic electorate who see him in the race - though one @-@ third believes that he should not do it .
if democratic voters are asked to the Party , who would be their second choice , is a lot of the top .
, and that Biden would be far from S@@ different .
if Biden is to run out , the choice of the Democrats is raised Hillary Clinton &apos;s head of S@@ different , from 20 points with Biden in the race for 30 points .
twenty @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chance to win , but that figure has fallen from 78 % last month .
Biden is a second @-@ sum proposition , but the percentage that has been the most visible and Euro@@ st@@ ber .
nevertheless , when the question is what is more important , Democratic voters call questions about the di@@ bility .
similar to these voters , like last month , is not a single democracy or potential candidate for these voters .
Democratic candidates or potential candidates are providing good results among some important features of their party &apos;s primary Party .
strong and more popular support with Clinton , S@@ different , and Biden as honest and credible and trustworthy and with strong leadership .
, while Clinton &apos;s strength is the leadership .
thirty percent of democratic voters believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy , twice the same is about S@@ 15 % ( 15 % ) , but 27 % have no opinion of him .
democratic voters in general view Clinton , S@@ different , and Biden , in con@@ formity with their views .
on all these measures .
because questions about Hillary Clinton &apos;s use of personal e - the desperate question of power and a ser@@ ade during the term as Secretary of State - will be to be satisfied with their explanation , and say that it has not affected their views on the whole .
but it is a different story in America &apos;s public as a whole .
one @-@ third satisfied is satisfied .
public opinion was in March in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the E is asking - the desperate controversy - the controversy that has not had a implications on her overall opinions of Clinton , though 36 % said that her opinion has deteriorated from her .
it is mostly Republicans , more than six from 10 , that their views of Clinton have been worse .
although Clinton is perceived as honest and trustworthy by voters &apos;s voters , this remains a problem for them under a single @-@ party voters : only 32 % see it as honest and trustworthy , eight % less than last month and 15 points less since May .
elected election voters do not think for a honest and trustworthy person .
at the same time , 55 % of the vote on a large scale are viewed as not honest and un@@ trustworthy .

Fed will be able to pass the interest rate on interest rates .
interest rates are coming , and the home will be fal@@ ter , yields on bonds will rise , and the economy will become mired into recession .
we know that .
thing we do not know how long it will last .
even for the economy , the story for the economy is low .
was expected to be a recession within 11 months .
the Federal Reserve &apos;s aggressi@@ veness is often , if not always , one factor how the economy and financial assets respond .
as a result , US officials have been reluctant to focus on when they begin to raise interest rates , rather than the period that need to be needed for normalization .
indeed , several variables play a role .
in the end of the rate hike may be exaggerated .
in fact , the Fed &apos;s first increase since the global financial crisis is inevitably a signal to the end of the era of the &quot; era &quot; ; the cheap money is being interpreted ; it said , and , when it comes to the end of the era of the &quot; one of the era , &quot; says , when Zhu J@@ ess@@ op , the chief economist at the Capital Economics , said in a university citizen
by contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US - high @-@ interest rates to normal heights , but still at low levels to fear the rest of the rest of shock that many seem to be feared .
there will be no effect .
thing to the economy is at historical lows .
as the last month , the pre @-@ term shift can be volatile for a while .
influence is not so dramatic .
moreover , there seems to be a tendency that asset @-@ price cuts will be cut up 12 @-@ 24 months after the first increase , which may be re @-@ delay in monetary policy , saying Germans - The Central Bank , said , and the ECB &apos;s monetary policy , while German analysts have been asking in a recent study what has happened to interest rates in the Fed .
more precisely , the market has been mostly flat in the past 35 years - about 14 % - on the way to the interest rate , with a average return in the last 35 days , with a average return in the last 35 days , with a average return in the last 35 days , according to a current analysis in the last 35 @-@ year cycles of the past six past cycles , with a average return
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on stocks tend to be later in the wake of the cycle , and the return on the return is beginning to decline .
to promote the economy .
in the current case , the Fed faces some conditions that could not be able to accelerate and accelerate a recession .
very remarkable is that GDP is close to the lowest rate of GDP in the Fed &apos;s lowest rate hike .
about the 1@@ 18 rate hikes since 1950 , the 1@@ 18 interest rate since 1950 was below 4.5 % .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 % , few expect that this will last , and expect only 1.5 % for the third quarter .
interest rates in so fragile economic vulnerabilities could be risky , raising the question of whether this time is different ; the Deutsche Bank said .
market participants have been prepared to raise the Fed &apos;s rate hike , and all eyes were at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on the scene that ends at the heart of the D@@ urs@@ day .
while many strategists and economists believe that the FO@@ M@@ C could approve a hike in this meeting , the futures - only a more 25 % probability of GDP .
&quot; in our study , all recent cycles cycles from 1950 to the present @-@ led world @-@ day , the report , and facing - the crisis of the world &apos;s pre @-@ GDP recovery , and facing the onset of the recovery - has been growing , according to the report .
by contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery of what the worst recession was in the interwar period .
the current cycle is far the longest that the Fed has been preparing since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and it has been 74 months .
it was also volatile , because the market is becoming an interest rate , and pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the impact on bonds is faster than stocks when their strategic course are changing .
in bonds , yields seem to move direction once the first increase in the cycle comes in the cycle .
&quot; the ban@@ lity cycle &quot; is the end of the upro@@ ol@@ ment cycle immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
as strategists of Charles gays believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to a return between longer and shorter bonds , leading to a decrease in the curve .
high @-@ rate bonds often result in a very better returns , although we are still careful to expect higher returns , said K@@ <unk> y , Fi@@ en@@ an , Fi@@ st@@ ing , and , in a sense , the p@@ st@@ ge@@ ing of the Exchequer , the K@@ amp@@ ess , the road to think .
interesting , then , that markets already have a Fed - the strategy of pressing - has adjusted to the point of expectations .
but the dollar &apos;s strength and the decline in inflationary expectations gives some signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy , they wrote .
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the green recovery has spread , and volatility has been rising , and volatility has been rising , if the Fed is tightening its strategy .
large and all , companies that would use the larger share of their business activities in the US will benefit if interest rates rise and local products more attractive .
multinational companies with large debt are worse off , as a rising dollar makes their products more costly to the global market , and the financing of their debt .
moreover , history shows that quality - quality - stocks tend to respond to a positive positive hike three months after an initial hike , Goldman Sachs , Goldman Sachs , and a report for customers .
firms with a strong record have exceeded a high percentage points after each of the rate hikes in 1994 , 1999 , and 2004 .
high capital is a high @-@ asset enterprise - the result of returns and low volatility in their stocks , with low quality at average ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage ) .
debt will be a big problem .
, with a high proportion of interest rates , Goldman and a high proportion of interest rates are released .
consumer @-@ run games are also benefiting by the rising dollar .
savers could see profits from higher returns , even if experts are different from different views , as quickly will take place .

when he is asked by a provider of child care , the issue was asked to call his favorite , the prime minister , the 1971 of the 1971 .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the site of the company super@@ C@@ ine , and : it continues : the notion , moving , creative , creative , and persistent : the world &apos;s Web site , moving , creative , and persistent , for it seems to be an image or a message that we have failed to have missed .

although he is to be a pragmatic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron &apos;s government is so unlikely to be the plot of the book , and there seems unlikely that Cameron &apos;s government is so little familiar .

but the bar@@ er Jer@@ e Cor@@ B@@ n , who had been in a friendly way to me on Mon@@ day &apos;s Mon@@ day , told him that he had no time to waste me - the threat of N@@ .@@ New no@@ k@@ ins &apos;s Washington strategy - he has said that he had no time to waste - seems to repeat the point of the 80 @-@ month &quot; N@@ .@@ movie &quot; strategy - he will
it may take a coherent strategy to win the media , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC is asking - a fa@@ d@@ a am .
Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s &apos;s official position to Europe is - I get it friendly - in the development .
we should remain in a reformed EU .
now , outside the traditional blan@@ st@@ ean corps of traditional blood - the tendency and wild their pra@@ des to the go@@ ys - is a recipe for the ch@@ ys &apos;s S@@ ast@@ ed@@ ors - a seduc@@ tive point of politics , but say , to say yes .
it is what the aid map is , one Ben@@ n , but no Ben@@ n@@ ite of the radio and television in radio and television , when the ad@@ ad@@ fin@@ gs was fought in him , was not admit that Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s &apos;s appointment of provocative John Mc@@ D@@ t@@ &apos;s appointment was a bad idea .
it reminded me to the 70 @-@ level of 70 - he took years when his old father sought to be dis@@ loyal to his Labour - the main cabinet to be dis@@ loyal to his Labour , without too far to go too far and losing his cabinet .
aid for the struggle was even more attractive .
but , to fight with the rest of the situation , and to remain , in all circumstances , what Mc@@ Mc@@ D@@ t@@ ell said , what J@@ C said his fellow combatants and legislators after all the reportedly on their board Day in Mon@@ day day .
whatever the high @-@ handed nature of the social media - the second @-@ time image of Cor@@ B@@ n &apos;s - is to think that he has even done me - remember that he has even done me - and , in the era of the soci@@ cal media , a breeding ground of paranoia and betrayal .
it is right to give Cameron out a free card for Europe , which allows him to keep Lab@@ support for granted to take a war for granted , as Mc@@ D@@ t@@ ell said .
Simon J@@ ew is sure to think .
but Mc@@ D@@ t@@ ell and Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s &apos;s fundamental added contribution to the EU - for membership - is a question of the es@@ gen@@ cal discussion of the EU - the country &apos;s main mi@@ a@@ s@@ iness - the very es@@ ot@@ stic debate of the very mi@@ cal discussion of a vital area of dogmatic disputes .
as with its multiple contribution to NATO - Watson is convinced that J@@ C will not campaign campaign to leave - will be obliged to try to find foreign diplomats in particular a sense of their superi@@ ors .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they have taken more wary voters - to make concessions to the British if that is all useless ?
the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya , and Syria , even with a reduction cut in the T@@ ory - the government of power , which I called a man at the Mon@@ day &apos;s Mon@@ day , a man called to the British In@@ itation of Central Forum .
experts criticize the report of Public Health England on e @-@ making .
claims of a government @-@ funded agency that funding for cigarettes are less damaging than smoking was from a meeting of 12 people , partly connected to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( B@@ M@@ J ) , a petition , and the UK &apos;s National Health England ( PTAs ) , a petition meeting the number of the public Health England ( PTAs ) , to be criticized by the National Health England ( PTAs ) in their report on the e .
the board is the &quot; Intergovernmental report &quot; issued , and the evidence is a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
but some researchers have challenged the resilience of data and had been pointed out to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
a editorial in the medical journal last month , a editorial in the medical journal The Lancet , has been struck on the scene , with the extraordinarily w@@ ff basis of the &quot; board &quot; on which the PTAs established its most important conclusion .
two other researchers write into B@@ M@@ Y , and have asked whether the claims are &quot; with no stone or sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ Ke@@ e , professor for European Public Health cs at the London School of Hy@@ giene and Tro@@ p@@ ony , and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , professor for small 19 am@@ ver@@ pool , said : A fundamental principle of public health is that policies based on the evidence of effectiveness .
they said that the public expects the argument that the argument is expected to be the case that the present estimate is that the current best estimate is to be to use the cause of 95 % less harmful than smoking , on a detailed review of the difference and Mo@@ del@@ fication of Mo@@ del@@ fication .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were called to develop a model for a added speci@@ criteria - the main analysis of Mul@@ ti - the meeting of the meeting was published in a research report .
Mc@@ Ke@@ e and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsors of the meeting was a firm called Euro@@ Health Health , whose chief director should be given by British American official official funds ( asked ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of asked for public health in a sustainability report , said they .
one of the 12 participants told the meeting , means of an e @-@ seeking to keep cigarettes to support the world &apos;s - but not funding , which he is supposed to receive the paper &apos;s tobacco companies , the tobacco companies , in the paper , Philip ently , they have .
the reasons for the choice of the body &apos;s members will not be met , but it includes several well @-@ known em@@ ges - the equivalent of cigarettes - to provide a industries - to fund a industries - to paper finance some of them .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know of know - the country &apos;s tobacco control .
the meeting took the tobacco , the head of the executive .
the group &apos;s research work is telling , and it is telling that there is a shortage of severe evidence for the most products most of the products ; there are , Mc@@ Ke@@ e and Cap@@ e@@ well .
we are discussed , not these links or restrictions on the part of the US@@ E .
to be sure , said that the claims of PTAs that it is no evidence that E is to be asking - to make cigarettes to smoking for children or no n@@ et@@ ers .
Pro@@ f of F@@ ent@@ on , director for health and well @-@ being at the staff e , said that the claims of B@@ M@@ Y has been addressed before .
he said : e @-@ cigarettes are far less damaging than smoking .
every second life smokers die .
all evidence suggests that the health risk of E is being dealt - the equivalent of cigarettes are small compared to the extent , but that we continue to have long @-@ term effects .
the public E has the clear duty to know the public about what the evidence is evidence and what is not , especially if there are so much public confusion about relative threats to tobacco .
nearly 80,000 people die each year on the smoking , and smoking costs two billion dollars per year .
the clear evidence of evidence that E is not risk , the damage caused by smoking , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we do our national jurisdiction .
CEO of Ch@@ ann@@ el give up 4 @-@ 4 @-@ ton , &quot; says a former head of Ch@@ ann@@ el &apos;s 4 @-@ 4 @-@ 4 @-@ 4
former head of Ch@@ Z@@ el 4 , Lu@@ ke Johnson , the BBC should stop to send programs like E@@ ast@@ En@@ back and The Vo@@ ice , saying that commercial rivals would be able to do so ; the w@@ it is asking , as he is the case of the Second e So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the TV used to make the kind of programs that cannot be used by other UK - the cur@@ ated station .
he criticized the BBC that they publicly to secure publicly - offering legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard disputed periods of her rivals , and broadcast like B@@ BC@@ 4 .
after the BBC is the world &apos;s largest director , Tony H@@ all , the company said more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he had tried for six years to come with the BBC six years at Cheney &apos;s prison .
I have been a recipe for me that the BBC has issued programs , or send to the House that were clearly not subsidized rivals , and send the upper house - the main Committee - the main Committee in his investigation over the BBC &apos;s future .
if you want to keep the TV stay , I should at least on programs that do not make others or spend .
they send The Vo@@ ice into a first @-@ time window of time because they want to reach the lowest broad support for their future .
the idea that no one else would show that , is a joke , it is ridiculous , of course nonsense .
Johnson said : I don &apos;t see the &quot; re@@ gressive tax programs that could be financed without subsidies . &quot; I don &apos;t see the question .
the bird ice is such a program , E@@ ast@@ En@@ ders , another , admittedly both of their productivity .
other channels would be put on their right .
of hope are supposed to be publicly asked .
not I think that this would be reduced the BBC .
Johnson , a entrepreneur of S@@ ain@@ , who started Ch@@ ann@@ el 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC &apos;s fault is the best for ratings ; because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support .
his comments to the BBC &apos;s most popular show , which the former head of sk@@ y , the former head of sk@@ y , Tony ball , in his Mac@@ meeting , Tony ball , suggested that the BBC should sell a mi@@ w like E@@ ast@@ En@@ os .
Johnson said that the more publicly - the legal game - the legal N@@ ical - the European Union &apos;s main programs , should be able to go to B@@ BC@@ 4 , but they can be able to go to B@@ BC@@ 4 , and they can argue if they are not measured by the audience , and they can be able to have all these obscure programs that no one has seen .
they are showing a window of time in which nobody wanted to see it .
as Johnson said the committee : I urge to find a more re@@ gressive system in terms of conditions that can be given the best value .
of course , you think everyone , think we all think we all think that you are all about 150 per year , but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 billion , I wonder whether they are not doing much from the BBC .
the former Sk@@ y@@ y@@ and Ch@@ Z@@ el - the leader of David El@@ stein , who also said the committee of the paper , called for the BBC to review its rice to be able to form the rice - the mission of mission , and to inform , and to be called to form and maintain .
he said that only the BBC &apos;s only BBC - had now been able to be officially described as education - for output and a 0.1 % in radio - and it should be in public @-@ public TV fields in Australia and Canada , for example , and to do so in public @-@ speaking , and educate , and talking with the public .
the UN &apos;s partnerships , the R@@ stein , should do more in areas like the pro@@ an@@ ters that he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and with commercial TV channels to make all online online .

the release that the trial of the day , C@@ hal@@ as@@ ani , researchers at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ a , California , said that the trial might day be able to replace the depths of the steam - the disease of the day , which is the electrical impulses to the brain of the symptoms of the Park@@ inson &apos;s disease - disease .
F@@ op@@ worms &apos;s treatment is usually not on Ul@@ sh@@ sh@@ al , but C@@ hal@@ as@@ ani found it that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid @-@ air air bubbles .
bubbles , he found out , increase the ultra @-@ chur@@ waves , which then enter into the worms .
the spread of Ul@@ oc@@ waves are on structures that the TR@@ P Strategy - the International I@@ air@@ channels , and the lines of some of the worms of the worms .
the pattern of these I@@ combatants and activ@@ ating cells that they are ordered is a report of Nature .

if he used to get ultra @-@ eu@@ all of the changed cre@@ ats , the spread of micro @-@ malaria is reinforced by micro@@ b@@ bs and en@@ vol@@ uting into the worms , where they are changing the altered engines of the two .
the process has some similarities with the list of options , a ground@@ To@@ ol , which allows scientists to get neurons with the road on the lights .
but C@@ hal@@ as@@ ani said that the S@@ o@@ an may have some advantages to this technology .
unlike light that a op@@ tic c@@ il@@ t in the brain is being clean@@ ed in the brain , the main cause of tissue can be made , and can be sent to the brain of top on the p@@ el .

in fact , the border controls of the border are also highly crowded to our southern border ; the Minister of Interior Minister a fa@@ l is a fa@@ l .
the controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
it still is clear that anyone who wants to issue a asylum @-@ settlement issue , of course , can be done .
people &apos;s supply and security are at the fore .
it is clear , however , that there are strong signals , and he said the ministerial ministers .
people must know that we do not accept vulnerable migration flows , including the most desperate - the country &apos;s most desperate border .
it needs a controlled approach .
it is a recipe of the game ;
the Cro@@ an government had previously been told to continue to leave Slovenia , including Slovenia , and continue to travel with the cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
this is what happened to the interior Minister V@@ es@@ na &apos;s Z@@ ni@@ na &apos;s Z@@ ni@@ na &apos;s Z@@ ni@@ na , but not to the L@@ an pi@@ am .
the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is totally unacceptable ; Slovenia will intensify the border of the border - especially Hungary - intensify .
Croatia is already heavily controlled as an area of the Schengen area .
as the ministerial minister pointed out , he intends to be eradicated in order to cut off its borders .
so , the EU &apos;s purpose of purpose - the EU &apos;s purpose of its obligations - is the system that the system cannot work ; it emphasized the system &apos;s decision @-@ headed .
as the Cro@@ an government told , the first refugees had already tried to go in the after@@ hours , in eastern j@@ ati@@ en on the border over@@ night To@@ <unk> e / Si@@ d , to avoid the stage .
@-@ to @-@ be the police police could take them in the near @-@ fields fields .
local media are hit in the Shanghai To@@ To@@ To@@ <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> orial @-@ type police vehicles .
it is , in fact , more often held Syrians and Afghans , including many women and children .
in the case of rescue services and the Red Cross .
in the coming days of right , his country , the interior minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic , said .
bro@@ il@@ c was brought to Croatia , reported a strong and Serb media on the sidelines .
but the government in Belgrade &apos;s government , however , denied that it is the people who are seeking to go to certain routine : neither can we do it ; it was .
the media reports , at least , is a first @-@ class story with roughly 50 refugees in the Serbian border town Si@@ d , when further b@@ uses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia , and Netherlands after Germany
the in@@ g@@ ots were the whole night from Serbia &apos;s six @-@ kilometer @-@ distant border border .
&quot; we have heard that Hungary has done , so the police said that we should go to the point ; &quot; he said of the refugees .
travel , they wanted to be wanted to Germany , Slovenia , and Netherlands .
indeed , it might now be the most likely @-@ predicted @-@ country @-@ old Hungary to make a little Western @-@ style Hungary .
Croatia : &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ;
Croatia &apos;s Minister minister of Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had to have emphasized that his country has prepared plans for the case of a strong influx of refugees to be prepared for possible exceptional situations .
details , he did not , he said he did not know that Croatia is a non @-@ sufficient , the main barrier to the failure of Croatia , and the comprehensive means of border control .
was hard controls to qualify for membership .
Slovenia is part of this since 2007 , the EU &apos;s main partner , and has provided a good illustration of what the standard of border controls is the price of border controls .
behind the Hungarian border , behind the Hungarian border .
the media report , according to media reports , would have spent the past night on the border over the fall of horror that leads to R@@ z@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border over@@ co@@ ding of Hormuz and B@@ oul @-@ B@@ i @-@ Bre@@ i remain utterly closed .
if the remaining refugees are to continue to go on , it is unclear .
Serbian Interior Minister Ne@@ bo@@ j@@ sa St@@ y@@ y@@ c tried to calm down at a local eye shine in horror , and he is finding the debates about alternative routes from refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
it would not be very large refugee numbers .
you cannot say whether they would continue their journey about Hungary , Croatia , or a different country .
@-@ like routes of migrants - dangerous - alternative routes .
but private @-@ Hungarian workers workers have already begun to distribute the refugees of land cards on which alternative routes are revealed by Croatia .
the border between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border , there are 20 years after the end of the Croatia war , there are still not a tra@@ mi@@ ed min@@ fields .
at the center of night , the People &apos;s police announced that a team of min@@ st was sent in the border region .

in their most expected meeting , Federal Reserve , two days , is currently a 27 @-@ kilometer - the world &apos;s most important - da@@ st@@ ard , the International table meeting , to decide whether it is time to decide whether it is time to take rate of interest for the first time for the first time for almost a decade .
it is about the end of the Soviet states , two @-@ round customs of the country &apos;s demise .
the map is a reminder that the Fed is turning to the question - the head of Chairman Jan@@ et L@@ et L@@ ern@@ es and their colleagues to the economic interests of the nation before all else .
the central bank has a double mandate of Congress : maximizing the US - employment and prices - is stable .
but , since the Great Recession , the Fed has acknowledged leaders that there are an unwritten third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the first @-@ to @-@ start factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict the unprecedented incentive from the pre @-@ zero interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of economics show that they have become solid , recent turmoil in global financial markets may be the most cautious Fed - the world &apos;s recent financial markets worry about increasing these volatility by raising interest rates for federal bonds - and is just one @-@ quarter point .
to be sure , the labor market and inflation are most important , and the main effect of the first place that they observe , said Lin@@ dse@@ y <unk> P@@ ho@@ g@@ za , chief of the business company , is now of a virtual case for the Co@@ pe .
I am , however , if they were looking for a pretext not to raise the interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough to stay for the job .
there is no consensus about what the Fed will do , which is spreading by themselves to the financial market .
for example , half of the economists who recently asked about Bloomberg have predicted this week .
financial markets , however , expect a Fed wait to be a key indicator of a key indicator that demonstrates only one 30 % chance .
this suggests a decline in the stock market , if the Fed raised the phrase that it promises to mitigate the blow by promising that further increases is far from being .

the action has caused expectations that the Fed has been asking - the politics he put this week &apos;s policy in this week &apos;s week - said John London &apos;s chief economist at Moody &apos;s &quot; Capital Monetary @-@ investment &quot; and a Capital Monetary @-@ investment panel .
it would be a surprise if the Fed would raise rates at this time , said he .
if they do it , she would have to go very far in their Declaration to calm financial markets , lest them to panic .
other experts argued that the rate hike would calm financial markets because they will eliminate uncertainty about when the Fed will act .
even a month ago , the Fed seemed to be on good ways to increase the phrase by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tightening of the monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ern@@ had the spring and early summer that they had been more economic advance , despite the complaints of liberals that more economic progress would be needed to raise the price of the economy .
although job creation slowed in August , improving the labor market was solid this year .
unemployment fell to 5.@@ 1 % last month , the lowest since more than seven years and near the Lev@@ ration that the Fed is at full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and , while inflation has been constantly going below the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the Fed has been asking - the Fed &apos;s reputation to support the temporary effect of the temporary oil prices .
the economy is going to be addressed ; higher interest rates , and it needs to be on the labor market , said I@@ an &apos;s for@@ son , the chief economist at a pan@@ the@@ on .
but financial markets , on the whole , last month around the world , after China devalued its currency .
the Dow Jones average dropped by more than 16 % in May , when investors feared that a slowdown in China &apos;s economy would slow global growth .
this month , the market has recovered something this month , with the Dow now growing by almost 10 % below the H@@ oke .
for the Fed , the world &apos;s turmoil influence the complex calculations of when to raise interest rates .
moreover , if events in financial markets and the news about the Chinese economy &apos;s weakness in the last few weeks were not , the policy meeting would be the policy in this meeting , said , Stephen D.

now he says that they will wait at least a month to get the impact better .
there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US is facing - the economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data that is what developments in China describe .
the health of the world economy is none of the central economy , so it should not be involved as a technically important role in its decision @-@ making .

a financial crisis in Asia has brought the Fed to cut its policy rate rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three meetings , despite limited implications for growth in the US ;
a year later , the Fed made the job of the world - the most generous representatives to reverse these cuts .
the Fed should place the aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis like the market collapse of 2008 , said Adam P@@ Po@@ sen , a former member of the Committee on the Bank of England .
the recent turmoil comes from the scene , he said .
you certainly want to be in the situation , which they fear a rate hike because markets are going to rise ; , once famously said , the president of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the Federal Reserve Act is still the dual mandate , and does not mention financial stability , and it does not mean that it should be expected to anticipate time .

that is a quality of some with the billionaire who will be able to be a president .
Con@@ ges@@ tions ( 69 ) is always well @-@ lived .
whether he reveals xenophobic , journalists , or knowledge of the international crisis policies - the US - is campaigning in the campaign .
and it is doing well .
this will also be registered in the service , where the grand@@ parents of the housing billionaire .
the New Yor@@ kers with F@@ ve@@ ing is a term in the Win@@ .
some in the 1@@ 200 - the world &apos;s residents - is the place of a gun , which is the world &apos;s largest 200 - the world &apos;s residents - is about to be about a lot of E@@ ick with him .
his grand@@ father came from K@@ all@@ z : Donald Con@@ an , where the campaign mode is .
the K@@ all@@ urban Court W@@ e@@ el turned a film on a roll of debate .
of the world &apos;s most powerful man ?
but I think that somehow seem exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their dress , says Sim@@ one W@@ end@@ el .
the native K@@ e@@ an , a am@@ ad@@ s@@ ic documentary on the ground and his famous sp@@ di@@ ts , is about to be turned to the same @-@ called , and the pi@@ et@@ et - the family family .
a fact that is not known for modest@@ y comes into the c@@ ings of K@@ all@@ town , ( 2014 ) , saying that he would be safe to do so if he would live in K@@ ine .
to the king of the heart , he didn &apos;t have brought it .
while there is respect for the family &apos;s performance , it also tends to think that there is a little @-@ big m@@ l , a bit a great m@@ l is a bad thing .
the top name of the top name , the top name of the top name , the K@@ em@@ city &apos;s c@@ circle , the K@@ der@@ j@@ es@@ maker &amp; nbsp ; The Mu@@ e@@ j@@ es@@ maker &amp; nbsp ; &amp; # 45 ; The An@@ e j@@ es@@ maker &amp; nbsp ; &amp; # 45 ; The An@@ e j@@ es@@ maker &amp; nbsp ; &amp; # 45 ; The An@@ e j@@ es@@ maker &amp; nbsp
much of the rest of the pur@@ ors is coming out of the village .
the t@@ st@@ ite scenario began in 18@@ 85 , when the later grand@@ father had been emigr@@ ated and in the US , and a Chinese @-@ style strike in the US .
in New York &apos;s housing system , the real estate company was created .
but the life of grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to go to the home in a home , failed to be a coup of the Argentine state , which was then included in P@@ j@@ z .
he did not accept a fact that he had not been able to do so because he once been im@@ don@@ ed without permission , and , in the absence of approval , the director of the Institute for the past , R@@ ol@@ and Paul , explains the film .
&quot; he is the grand@@ cle of a &quot; illegal resort . &quot;
that is in contrast to the sometimes @-@ mark@@ ous statements of the descendants .
the had been repeated of Mexican immigrants in the US , and calls for building a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
as a result , the idea is not so much @-@ appealing , says Hans E@@ - For@@ Jo@@ y , a remote Japanese card ( &amp; nbsp ; The O@@ ma was a born @-@ born pl@@ er , the op@@ a was born ) . )
the Win@@ er in retirement is more like the Americans , and he is always so br@@ br@@ ch@@ able .
does he believe that , here , is a lot ?
I can &apos;t imagine what I think ; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine the 72 . &quot;
E@@ r never around the sick .
the pension of Ver@@ ge@@ h@@ te , as some K@@ e@@ ti@@ ad@@ ad@@ ad@@ ad@@ ad@@ ad@@ ad@@ ad@@ ad@@ ad@@ ad@@ ad@@ ad@@ ad@@ ad@@ ad@@ ad@@ ad@@ , mentioned that a taste of the family &apos;s family was giving something to a similar ch@@ am , which is generally well used to do .
I am not a &quot; one . &quot; I can &apos;t imagine what I am &quot; The Secretary of Donald . &quot;
they would be better off if he is not going to vote , because such radical views , I do not know whether the good is .
if those who had been in charge at the time of his great v@@ vers , he would have never been &quot; there . &quot;
as a result , there are more than him , &quot; says Win@@ cer@@ to@@ ar , B@@ b@@ ler .
and is the president ?
she is not .

at the moment when I had been going to the house and noted of energies ( Sar@@ r ) and S@@ ams energies , I felt that they were pretty compatible , and I observed that they were fairly compatible in the course of the S@@ thought , said , by example , by Jean @-@ rat@@ e , the main fields .

what is the &quot; critical point of this study , &quot; because it says that this operation in this low B@@ M@@ I - the largest group is a lower group , without risking the death or a kidney disease , she said .
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously once the patient is between 27 and 30 .
I think that we are too long waiting to get people to take this seriously , said they said .
I think that once they have raised these genetic changes , which have linked their body with obesity and diabetes , a reversal is really difficult to be .

I can guarantee that we have nothing to do with our defensive system or the techniques , but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with a real focus , and that has done us the turnaround .
ch@@ ent is now there for three years , and he has apparently become a big team , so he is probably not accustomed to losing it , so it was a sign of him .
that is happening to this season .
B@@ iter &apos;s idea has been the idea of the idea of tension football , attacked , and his mentor , reminds his mentor , reminds that Ben@@ ter is dra@@ us@@ ly on the Premier League in 2010 with the prime minister , and soccer won .

he has been compared to his game on Satur@@ day day , with our most on the Fri@@ day day , compared to our game , and how to do her game was a for@@ eg@@ sh , &quot; b@@ iter . &quot;
I remember that George W. George W. George W. 2010 was criticized by George W. 2010 , and V@@ ay@@ ne said that he would be concerned about a li@@ e @-@ on .
but now he has a team that can play and we look at an exciting , particularly his young players with their speed .
it is the game game that you want to play .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team , two players like the Czech ony of Czech ony Mil@@ ford and Ben H@@ <unk> , so that they can play like them .
I build stronger trust because they say this things because they are a bit worry to play against us .
six weeks ago , they might not be thought to be conceived as Big business .
B@@ iter &apos;s argument also pointed out that the game played out in the way to be a higher outcome than the G@@ on@@ sian case against a co@@ wn .
the game of the B@@ ron@@ ite was arguably a good game , I have not yet been seen , but what ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts at our game , but is the real game ?
so is a bit of tension ?

back Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : we create the &quot; one &apos;s &quot; ; we create the &quot; game . &quot;
the influx of refugees is a huge challenge - the German Chancellor determined to take them .
turn is too on Germany ?
around 800 , asylum seekers are expected to come after the federal average Office &apos;s forecasts , according by Deputy economist Vice @-@ Deputy Si@@ g@@ ler ( SPD ) , Germany is even capable of joining a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) , facing the unusual challenge of resolve : I say and again again : we can create this , and we can create it .

what is needed is the various forecasts of 3@@ 50,000 of the federal R@@ Office ( estimate of the federal R@@ Office ) and the 17@@ 0@@ an Office ( estimate of P@@ est@@ el - the P@@ est@@ el Institute - the P@@ est@@ el Institute - the next five years .
now is built &quot; ( 25@@ 0@@ 0,000 homes ) .
the lack of housing , particularly at the affordable mix of the mi@@ et@@ ons , is a year of $ 60@@ 0,000 @-@ 800,000 social homes , and those particularly favorable housing will be for refugees .
in addition , the head of Defense Minister General Minister General a H@@ end@@ ri@@ se ( SPD ) wants to double , the number of 5@@ 18 million on a billion euros .
too little is the point of the P@@ est@@ el - the International Institute : 80 @-@ mile of social income , and that would require an increase of $ 6.@@ 4 billion per year .
what is agreed to be in agreement and federal @-@ sector leaders is that there must be more tax advantages for investment in housing .
according to the Institute of the Institute for labor market and professional research , it is assumed that 55 % of the dreaded in Germany are in the short run .
but the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked to help them up , criticized , Clau@@ dia , project , and education in Ber@@ fying the disease .
get refugees is crucial to integration .
work is the key to social contacts , for which the value of the absor@@ bers , but also for the self @-@ esteem of migrants , tells us of chronic learning .
in Germany , there has been a political change in Germany : the authorities banned from labor to refugees is being done .
while it took a labor ban on asylum @-@ seekers , and , as a result , the number of asylum @-@ seekers has been reduced in November 2014 , and the Re@@ c@@ cy that limits asylum @-@ seekers to a residential site .
in society , too , the view has been given that refugees will have more quickly to be allowed to labor access .
obstacles to the labor market is a lack of a kind of under@@ tak@@ ant labor market .
existed has been insufficient to offer general and professional @-@ based language .
in the most common way , are the most often connected to the most frequent contacts .
the building of networks is therefore a view of the royal path to work integration .

yet to convince the families , the administration &apos;s administration is distributed in different languages .
if the need to appeal to the number of refugees is rising sharply , the Berlin Senate would seek to increase educational capacity - for example , by allowing more skilled schools .
lack countries are prepared to be prepared without a little @-@ handed college in the classroom .
they are not always educated by a skilled faculty and teachers , but , as in Berlin , the teachers who have only a single @-@ quality background .
there is no shortage of any shortage , says Be@@ zz@@ als of the Berlin school .
, about 20 % of refugees in Germany , want to study .
in principle , no state @-@ seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception has been Berlin , interior Minister Frank Hen@@ cle , ( CDU ) , but his stance has been abandoned .
result could be made to be made easier to the high school .
for refugees with a return of interest or acquies@@ ance , no benefit in the asylum @-@ seekers bill is more than an study .
the latter is not a b@@ af@@ gue , because they do not fall under the circle of the people .
displaced refugees had to have lived in Germany four years in Germany , to be a min@@ af@@ g of the Americas - the right to be justified from January 1 , 2016 , and reached this 15 @-@ month .
this financing gap must be closed , but the St@@ ch of Kra@@ ch , Ber@@ l@@ s &apos;s State secretary for science , and the Germans .
students should get a glaci@@ t .
Islam will play a more important role in determining , because many refugees are Muslims , and many are important to many , and for many , religion is important part of their identity .
the state should put to Islam , and the existing state - desperate churches - is pressing to a new state - the country &apos;s religions - to create a new state - to create the country &apos;s religions .
it is important to the establishment of an Islamic welfare group that is professional to be used to be held by newcomers .
the right includes responsibilities .
Islam must agree on clear requests between some and willing to work with the state in many areas , giving him some control of control .
it is a willingness to crack up on religious fundamentalism .
the head of Muslims &apos;s central council , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ z@@ z@@ k , said the concern that religious conflicts could be taken after Germany .
those who wanted to carry out such conflicts in Germany , immediately have their right to be said in Germany , and they have been right to go back in Germany , said he , in Bav@@ ri@@ u , said .
ab@@ ounds &quot; the Basic Law suggested .
much are a matter of society all over society .
they will have to change the majority of discrimination and racism will be necessary .
Germany - as a result of European decisions - has an anti @-@ discriminatory and general equal @-@ enforcement law for a short decade .
but it is very slow , as the N@@ S@@ U has shown the racist motive , to show the racist motive , in the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive .
equal opportunities for everyone : what migrant organizations and interest interests of non @-@ racial Germany commit long to be a commitment to the anti @-@ racial Convention on Germany , and why international agreements such as the anti @-@ racial Convention on Germany will need to become real in the next few years if the country is peaceful and its new civic citizens are to use their ways - for the sake of all .

in the federal countries , services could be expected to be expected to fall .
and , in the long run , it is highly doubtful to let @-@ pay so many people with limited performance , which is the asylum @-@ market bill .
to make physicians especially the language barriers .
so far , the Berlin &apos;s health @-@ care scientific philosophy has been showing a lot of notice , making migrants worse about their diseases than other patients .
not only in clinics , including medical practice , would require a need to be taken on the costs , called for a medical costs .
but many refugees would be able to be in the emergency polls with more general medical channels .
another diagnostic look .
there are , for example , more un@@ volatile disabilities , and the youth is growing about HIV - the culprit of HIV - the culprit of the young community .
by the part of other cases , German doctors would be clear from their training , however , that he is aware of being .
the refugees may even be seen as difficult to identify , or , in terms of the health , the refugees may even be relieved in sight .
qualified were a advanced educational system , the Syrians would have a advanced educational system .
to practice practice , would have to show their skills and may be allowed again .
at least half of the refugees in Germany , according to the federal psycho@@ tor at least , is mentally ill @-@ conceived , most suffer from a post @-@ traumatic panic disorder or under depression .

the broader picture for the arsenal is that it had six from eight games since 2007 / 08 since 2007 / 08 , which have seen most vulnerabilities .

for those who are not depressed , a circle of mental healthy friends is half the risks of mental problems .
, friends have yet to work with it .
in the age of the social media communications , with its emphasis on style , the answer often is more central than a significant one .
our digital lives have the need to appear strong , and successful , even if the isolation dominates isolation .
this superficial success is dominated by what psychologists are ex@@ in@@ aire . money , image , social status , all at the expense of values , and friendship that affect much deeper health .
but , like a video match , invent@@ ors and billionaire , it is , cannot buy happiness .

it is not easy to win at home or near @-@ up in the champions of the champions , so it is a good start to win : 0 : 0 to win our opponents and take back on the ground , even if there are particular things that we have to perfect , even if there are certain things that we have to perfect , and to perfect , have been able to perfect .
the reason is good .
we wanted to win and have won , though I have no chance that we do not yet either another or two other goals .

it was also important cycles that are issues like cross@@ , p@@ est@@ es , or our address .
he has been fascinated by several partners : the culprit of the White tion - the responsibility behind his theological orientation , as well as for the plaintiffs , was a source of his focus on art books .

as a result , the &quot; says Al@@ k &quot; : Hi@@ er is about the images that the text says only a &quot; text . &quot; was born , one of the images that the text had merely been &quot; ; &quot; was a images of fear - the be@@ ble of the text .

the economy must open more broadly to the outside , but President Xi Jinping said a group that has been charged with the governance of reform .
in fact , China should be used to attract foreign investment and know - and to improve the strategies for business initiatives ; , in a view , he said in a recent session at the 16th meeting of the Central leadership group for a comprehensive reform .
new momentum and promoting reforms will be renewed and more competitive for economic growth , but Xi said .
the leadership group has adopted a set of guidelines , including a negative list of market access , the mandate of border controls - the Strategy of the state of market access ( the National E ) , which is resolved by state @-@ owned enterprises ( the creation of L@@ E ) , private capital , and the source of the inhabitants - the Mel@@ Mel@@ system of the people .
the statute will be based on a negative list of the sectors and businesses that are not being challenged for investment .
more than tested and re@@ improved by testing programs .
the initiative is important because it provides a greater role in allocation of resources , a legal state environment , and establishing the market open , said the statute .
the government will also ease controls on companies and make sure that companies choose how to do their business .
the statute also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
to be open , in a supply of supply , state @-@ controlled sectors , more areas of private investment will be opened .
the government will not change its policies toward foreign investment , and will protect the legitimate interests of leveraged companies and provide better services to them , said the statement .
moreover , it will be easier for foreigners to be a permanent residence or the &quot; Green C@@ ard &quot; ; green C@@ ard , the demands of the process , by making the demands for the job process .

in exchange for this relaxation , the EU is seeking to exacerbate the limits on other F@@ ian from currently 0.5 @-@ meter per kilograms of mercury per kilograms of mercury per kilograms .

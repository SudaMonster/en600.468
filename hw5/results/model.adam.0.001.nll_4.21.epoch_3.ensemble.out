8 poll show that Donald ales is serious .
some have tried to get him as a fl@@ op .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
some wait for a collapse .
nevertheless , no matter how some Republicans are trying to draw on the top . &quot; has not worked .
in the chances of the last 11 @-@ real national nomination , Donald Moore &apos;s , means , and some begin to think seriously about the chances of real estate &apos;s nomination .
it is , of course , early in the electoral term .
no one claims that , most likely , the Republican nomination will likely win .
experts stress that , in 2011 , Rick P@@ ain &apos;s leadership was found in the process of 2011 &apos;s Nobel C@@ ain , which no one state in the process of the process won .
and there are many reasons why he would have in a general election .
now , outsiders , such as Jean @-@ Bush &apos;s super @-@ Bush &apos;s super @-@ Sup@@ er , PA@@ C and the conservative economic group Club for Growth and begin to leave their dollars to topple it .
here is not only a temporary phase : the modus gu@@ l is not only a temporary period :
increases &apos;s popularity ratings have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before only two of ten Republicans announced the real estate - Mo@@ gu@@ l positive that only two of ten Republicans saw real estate - Mo@@ gu@@ gu@@ l positively saw real estate .
by mid @-@ July , it was 40 % .
August was 52 % .
now six of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald degrees .
for example , three of 10 say that they have a negative opinion .
these numbers are holding in early states .
1 % of Republicans have a good say that 60 % of Republicans have a good say .
two @-@ thirds of the G@@ O@@ P - E@@ O@@ P , G@@ O@@ P , would be happy to be a candidate .
in a survey of CNN / F@@ C last week , 67 % of Republicans said that they would be either fixed ; or &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp;
only two of 10 say , they would be angry ; if he were the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son creates roughly the same enthusiasm as there is , 43 % say , the same enthusiasm of 40 % who say the same thing in the same way ) .
the next thing in enthusiasm ?
Mar@@ co calls with only 21 % .
on the other side , 47 % of Republican voters say that they would be unhappy ; if not , Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a Republican majority does not look as a problem .
while Donald widespread evidence is widely criticized for his bom@@ bas@@ tic and offensive statements , 52 % of Italy &apos;s voters , who believe that the real estate is the right temper@@ ament for a president , so A@@ BC News / Washington Post on Mon@@ day .
the same number of the nation &apos;s first week , the state of state , where the same 52 % of Republicans think that he has a stake , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ k ac last week .
of this , 44 % say that his temper@@ ament does not go into the White House , so that his temper@@ ament does not go into the White House , so A@@ BC / Post .
Republican voters get used to the idea .
when they are putting their subjects , Republican voters hold that they are real in real terms .
if they are asked who is the most likely bet on the G@@ O@@ P .
this is a change since the time four from 10 end of 10 ended its money on Y@@ b Bush .
full disclosure : G@@ O@@ P is not the most obvious crystal ball in the past .
at this point in the last cycle , four of ten Republicans thought that the nomination would win the nomination only 28 % for the final candidate Mitt Romney .
yet shows that a number of G@@ O@@ P has shown that a number of G@@ O@@ P is an understandable view .
even if the Republicans collec@@ ts around another candidate , there is almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to the leadership , while the anti @-@ Americanism - the threat to which the anti @-@ Americanism - the threat of the Americas - is being distributed to more than a dozen other candidates .
but in early September , at the beginning of September , at the beginning of September , at the beginning of September , at the beginning of September , at the beginning of September , at the beginning of September , it shows that in a hypothetical head - the presidential race - and most other Republican candidates , a majority of liberal support .
it has been on the brink of 13 points before Mar@@ b Bush , and , finally , on the brink of Paul , John cents , and Chris <unk> e @-@ 33 items .
it is an head of responsibility - the head of power - for the sake of t@@ ed C@@ ru@@ z .
the only candidate that suggests him ?
Ben Car@@ son would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head - a vice race .
a near @-@ time majority of Donald challenges - &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; #
a new poll by CB@@ S / N@@ Y@@ T on service shows that only more than half of the voters who support them say that they have more than half of the electorate who support their votes .
of course , much can be done to change this , and nobody can never say that it never to change .
46 % said that they can make the door open to change other candidates .
nevertheless , the most powerful competition at the moment of the other maver@@ ick , the neur@@ och@@ o Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say that they have formed their opinion are twice as frequent .
six of 10 Republicans say that they are related to immigration .
since in his campaign , &quot; the immigration was turned out of the public discourse .

but , according to the new A@@ BC / Post &apos;s new A@@ BC / Post , six from 10 Republicans say that they agree with the issue of immigration .
so long as immigration is in the spotlight on the spotlight in the spotlight , it will seem to do so much to do so .
frustration with the government is soaring at the highest levels .
now roughly half of the support of Republican voters , especially through their maver@@ ick , has been growing .
six of 10 Republicans want to be a political outsider as someone with government experience .
they are also angry to Washington .

Europe &apos;s sovereign @-@ crisis crisis : Hungary , the border , extends to the border , keeps refugees back to refugees , and keeps refugees back to refugees .
Hungary explains the influx of migrants , and held the southern border with Serbia .
chaos responded in the border , when hundreds of migrants responded in a kidney country , and Serbian officials with indignation responded .
people who fled violence have been found for an unknown period in the streets between the two control of the country and built up there .
but frustrations rose . &quot;
when a police helicopter against them , the migrants were opening !
some had returned to protest and water .
Serbia &apos;s foreign minister declared that migrants were sent back from Hungary , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece .
( Serbia ) wants part of the solution , not collateral damage .
in the coming days of talks with Brussels and other countries , it said I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague .
a day after 28 - the nations of a day after 28 - The nations of a day in Brussels was not consistent with a disputed meeting in Brussels .
but the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people , who sought to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in Italy and Greece .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special summit in the European Union to discuss the continent &apos;s immigration crisis .
Hungary , however , did not set his hopes for an early action of Brussels or from its neighbors .
the need to deal in two southern regions had more powers to cope with the crisis in two southern regions , so that they could accelerate the streets and accelerate asylum @-@ seekers .
meanwhile , the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ ak@@ to , meanwhile , said that his country also had the construction of a pile of a pile along its border with Romania to stop the influx of migrants from the country - after joining a fence on the Serbian border .

in the Middle East , Hungary and elsewhere in the Middle East has become a significant English , and the European Union has become a significant point in the European Union .
but Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted that most of the economic agents who are in search for a better life , and not prisoners of war , claim for protection - a view that is strongly at odds with other EU - the states , including Germany .
the new laws that joined a force in Hungary , the new laws , and the damage of the 4 @-@ 4 ated ( 13 meters ) , will make us a crime ( 13 ) that the government could build on a crime with the southern border to Serbia , a crime , as well as higher prison sentences for convicted human traffickers .
as a result of the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the state state of state , and , in the southern city of S@@ ol@@ tan Ko@@ l &apos;s reporters in the southern city .
we say it very clear : the illegal border over a crime is a crime .
parliament must be able to be seen on the use of the military , which will be expected for next week , but reporters in the border have heavily seen armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days .
indeed , the country &apos;s leading @-@ 15 Bak@@ on@@ di , said that the country has already entered 45 &apos;s people in trying to cross the border . 15 others were already deeper in the country .
we are accused of the fence , they are now accused of police in police custody and are accused of the new laws .
authorities are quick to fix the fence .
Hungarian officials joined two of the seven border signatories with Serbia after a train train to close borders to the borders .
chaos close to the data of the people in a metal of all the world &apos;s major border , including Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal of all - he opened up the data of people and asked a crowd in order to get back on it .
about 20 , thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main act of Hungary - a combination of Serbia blocked Hungary and Hungary , saying that they would deny food and water until they can go to Hungary .

but Clinton still has a big margin among older voters .
last month , Clinton was head @-@ à @-@ vis @-@ à @-@ vis liberals in the last month .
if they were nominated by the party , about half of the EU &apos;s democratic voters .
a quarter would support them with some of them , and another 15 % would support them only because it is the candidate .
they would not support six % .
perhaps not surprisingly , Clinton &apos;s current supporters are primarily enthusiastic .
the views are stronger in those who currently support Clinton - only about a quarter , a quarter would support them .
while 35 % say &quot; with enthusiasm , say , 48 % of the Democratic electorate say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , say less Republican voters about their top presidential candidates ( 35 % ) .
if Clinton is asked in an open question ( 16 % ) , the most common answer is that a woman is president ( 13 % ) , followed that a woman is president ( 13 % ) , and that it is the best candidate for the job ( 10 % ) .
by Clinton &apos;s supporters , their association with Bill Clinton ( 9 % ) is mentioned .
agreement for dealing with problems and di@@ titude will also be cited .
with Vice President a potential for the presidency , 57 % of democratic voters want to see him in the race - though one @-@ third believes that he should not do it .
if democratic voters will be asked for the party , who would be their second choice , Biden at the top .
of Clinton &apos;s supporters , more than half , that Biden would be far from S@@ different .
certainly is in the race for 30 points , with Biden in the race for 30 points , with Biden in the race for 30 points .
twenty @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chance to win , but has fallen from 78 % last month .
Biden is a second in this measuring , but the percentage that has been on him as a &quot; elec@@ ous one . &quot;
yet , at the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about voting .
similarly , no single democracy candidate or potential candidate for these voters is proving unacceptable .
the Democratic candidates , or potential candidates , provide good results in some important features of their party &apos;s primary Party .
they see Clinton , S@@ different , and Biden as honest and trust and with strong leadership .
Biden is best at honesty for the three candidates , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the leadership .
( 15 % ) , Clinton &apos;s voters believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy , but 27 % have no opinion of him .
democratic voters in general see Clinton , S@@ different , and Biden , in con@@ formity with their views .
for all of these measures , about one @-@ quarter of democratic voters .
because questions about Hillary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal em@@ E call for a personal e - call to ask - and to continue to be tried as Secretary of State during the term as Secretary of State , most Democratic voters are satisfied with their explanation , and say that it has not affected their views on the whole .
but it is a different story in America &apos;s public as a whole .
half of Americans are unhappy with their explanation , while only one @-@ third is satisfied .
public opinion was divided in March , just after the problem came to light .
36 % said that their opinion has deteriorated from her or worse .
Republicans are worse , more than six from 10 , who say that their views of Clinton have become worse .
although Clinton is perceived to be honest and trustworthy by the voters of their party as honest and trustworthy , this remains a problem for them among voters as a whole : only 32 % see it as honest and trustworthy , eight % less than last month and 15 points less since May .
in 62 % of the electorate they do not think for a honest and trustworthy person .
at the same time , 55 % of the electorate &apos;s voters have not been honest and un@@ trustworthy .
but Clinton and the Caribbean , however , receive good No@@ ds in leadership . &quot;
of the six @-@ ended candidates , Biden , Car@@ son , and Bush are best in honesty .
a majority is more likely to be honest , but , like Car@@ son , many do not think of him .
the error rate for the validity of 3@@ 51 Democratic Democratic voters is 6 percentage points .

Republican voters continue to support a 27 % in the large number poll in the last month .
but Car@@ son shot the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
the poll also revealed that Car@@ son is well superior to demographic groups , with higher education among Republican voters with higher education .

that will happen when the Fed increases interest rates to raise interest rates .
interest rates will rise , and the economy will fal@@ ter into recession , and the economy will rise into recession .
we know that .
we do not know how long it will last , and how long it will last .
in particular , history is limited to the economy .
a recession came from just 11 months after the first rate of interest @-@ rate hikes and lasted 86 months .
the Federal Reserve &apos;s aggressi@@ veness is often , if not always , one factor how the economy and financial assets respond .
as a result , US Federal Reserve officials have stressed that investors should not focus on raising interest rates , but rather on the period that norm@@ alizes .
indeed , several variables play a role .
in the end , however , market participants may find that the whole excitement of interest rate may be exaggerated .
in fact , the Fed &apos;s first increase since the global financial crisis is bound to be a signal to the end of the era of the era ; cheap money is being interpreted ; read , read J@@ ess@@ op , the chief economist in Capital Economics , in a community of customers .
by contrast , we do not expect a gradual return to the US - high interest rates , but still at low levels to fear that many seem to be feared .
but this does not mean that there will be no effect .
here is a historical record of historical trends on how some areas of the economy could respond :
as the market has seen in the past month , expect interest rate hikes can be volatile for a while .
once raising increases , the influence is not so dramatic .
to be sure , there seems to be a tendency that asset @-@ rate analysts will have 12 @-@ 24 months after the first increase , which may well reflect delay in monetary policy .
market published in the last 35 cycles , with a average return in the last 35 days , according to an average return in the last 35 @-@ year cycles of 1@@ 4.4 % , according to a current analysis in the last 35 days , with a average return in the last 35 @-@ year cycles in the last 35 days , with a average return in the last 35 @-@ year cycles in the last 35 days
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on stocks tends to occur in the wake of the cycle , and the rate of return is beginning to decline .
recessions are a fact of economic life .
in the current case , the Fed faces some conditions that could not have occurred , and that could accelerate a recession .
what is highly remarkable is that GDP will be near its lowest interest rate hike .
according to the Deutsche Bank , the 1@@ 18 interest rate since 1950 was below 4.5 % .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 % , few expect that this will last , and expect only 1.5 % for the third quarter .
so fragile economic Bank could be risky and raise the question , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank .
in the Fed &apos;s interest rate , and all eyes were at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in this week .
as many strategists and economists believe that the FO@@ M@@ C could approve an increase in that meeting , the futures of trade is only a 25 % probability .
as the study , in our study , the report cycles . in our study , all wave cycles cycles from 1950 to the day @-@ in @-@ a @-@ half world .
by contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery of what caused the worst recession .
the current cycle is far the longest that the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months .
the firm income , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the impact on bonds is faster than stocks when their strategic course change course .
as a result , the returns to change once the first increase in the cycle comes in the cycle .
at the end of the broken cycle , bond yields fall down , the Deutsche Bank said .
increases in the interest rate lead to an increase in interest rates between longer and shorter bonds .
high @-@ rate bonds often yield better returns in such a climate , though we are still careful to expect higher returns .
interesting , then , that markets have already adjusted to the Fed - the strategy of fiscal policy .
it adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy , it wrote that the market has adjusted to tighter monetary policy .
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , and volatility has risen , and volatility has risen - all of the market , if the Fed aggrav@@ ates its strategy .
in large and local goods , companies who use the larger share of their business activities in the US will benefit if interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies make their products more costly to the global market , as well as the financing of its debt .
moreover , &quot; Goldman Sachs &quot; predicted , Goldman Sachs , Goldman Sachs - &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp
firms with strong balance sheet have exceeded 5 percentage points after each of the rate hikes in 1994 , 1999 , and 2004 .
percentage @-@ capital firms , and lower volatility in their shares , also out@@ hit their counterparts with low quality of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will be a big problem .
companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose most .
outside the cash games , consumers are also benefiting by the rising dollar .
experts could see profits from higher returns , even though experts are different .

it is a historic event , because the Fed has put interest rates on zero .

Adam Libya was clearly threatened , but it is still difficult for the exclusion of England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult to see it .
confronting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you have chosen the cadres that the England has chosen for the Tour is a repeat of the 3 t - Georgia &apos;s defeat was not on my map .
I would not rule out an exit .
A@@ load , however , may have gotten less positive than the three years ago , but there is a positive attitude in the batteries - and the common spirit is strong ; they will not carry out in 2012 - and the common spirit is strong ; they will not carry a youthful position in 2012 .
he is an unknown size to the test , one option is an option for attack .
the related news is that Adam x H@@ ales is replaced by the England - the test challenge - Adam cadres , and is replaced by Ale@@ x .
, of course , the decision to analyze Adam Libya &apos;s th , of course , is hard to analyze me .
in his seven tests , there were two good assaults under difficult conditions , and the easy but harsh reality is that krill players are designed to results .
there were no question at Joe Ro@@ ot , for example , and I have said that , for example , their own best choices are .
it would have been extended long ago , but he had the control of his own fate .
if he hopes , another chance will be another chance .
the England , for example , openly praised his stance , even if he did not perform so good , and not surprised me ; he is a man who is , above all , a team .
the question , as much time a test , is challenging .
ly@@ th , seven opportunities - like Sam ro@@ son before him - was given to seven opportunities , while N@@ ick &apos;s ton was nine .
only a decade got the chance to be held and exit .
the only charge is now in the past .

it is a X of a X - a factor that is a source of responsibility - a Canadian chess player , as he saw 2@@ 36 in this season when he took 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ y Bri@@ dge , making us very close to us .
he needs to be at least the same chance , of course , but this will depend on the basis of the team in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea of an example would be able to strike mode along with Germany , which would give an example of an exodus - turning out - p@@ w@@ ler and four Qu@@ ic@@ ks , &quot; and I would do nothing about it , and I did nothing about it .

but the plant Jer@@ e Cor@@ B@@ n , which I gave me to me on Mon@@ day &apos;s Mon@@ day , he told him that he had no time to waste me to waste for me - and he told him that he had no time for me to waste - seems to be repeated in danger of repeating N@@ .@@ New no@@ ed@@ ov &apos;s boycott of 80 power - a mistake then and now .

the evidence ; the evidence of the last month and describes him as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
but some researchers have challenged the resilience of the data and have pointed out to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
in the medical journal last month , and the most important conclusion on which the US@@ E has established its most important conclusion .
two other researchers write into B@@ M@@ Y , and have asked whether the claims goes back ; on a stone or sand .
Martin Mc@@ Ke@@ e , a professor for European public @-@ health care in the London School of Hy@@ giene and Tro@@ p@@ ony , and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , professor for L@@ ony epidemi@@ ology at the University of Li@@ ver@@ pool , said : a fundamental principle of public health is that policies should be based on the evidence of the effectiveness .
they said that the public is expected to believe that the current @-@ best estimate is that the current best estimate is that , say , 95 % are less damaging than smoking , on a detailed review of the difference and Mo@@ del@@ ration .
indeed , this statement comes from a single session of 12 .
Mc@@ Ke@@ e and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsors of the meeting was a firm called Euro@@ Health Health , whose chief director should have received an independent study .
he also signed the credentials of asked for public health in a sustainability report , said they .
one of the 12 participants agreed to preserve funds from an e @-@ bailout - aid to cigarettes - to preserve cigarettes , but not to finance funding , which he is supposed to be awarded by the tobacco companies Philip ed International &apos;s tobacco companies .
the reasons for the members of the panel &apos;s members will not be met , but this includes a number of well @-@ known e @-@ making to the paper .
some other participants at the meeting are not well known for their know of their know @-@ à @-@ vis tobacco control .
at the meeting , tobacco .
the group &apos;s research work is telling . that there is a shortage of harsh evidence to the damage of most products on most criteria ; there are , Mc@@ Ke@@ e and Cap@@ e@@ well .
but none of these links or restrictions on the US@@ E will be discussed .
Mc@@ Ke@@ e and Cap@@ e@@ well said that it is no evidence that there has been no evidence that around the e , there has been no evidence that around the end of the e .
Pro@@ f , director for health and well @-@ being , said that the claims of B@@ M@@ Y had already been addressed before .
he said : &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ;
up to each addiction .
all evidence suggests that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects .
there is a clear duty to public information about what is proof of tobacco , and what is not , especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers of tobacco .
nearly 80,000 people die each year on the smoking , and smoking costs two billion dollars per year .
as a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we meet our national jurisdiction .
the BBC should abandon E@@ ast@@ En@@ ders , says a former head of Cheney &apos;s 4 @-@ 4 @-@ 4 @-@ 4 4
former head of Ch@@ Z@@ el &apos;s 4 , Lu@@ ke Johnson , has said that the BBC should stop using programs like E@@ ast@@ ac@@ m and The Vo@@ ice ; he said that commercial rivals would be able to do so ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45
Johnson said that the type of programs should be used only to make the kind of programs that cannot be diverted by other UK .
he criticized the BBC &apos;s most publicly - offering legal programs , which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience .
in partnership with the BBC - Director General , Tony H@@ all , said that companies wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he had tried for six years to come with the BBC for six years .
to be sure , I have done problems with the idea that the BBC spends on behalf , or sends to the upper house of the BBC , the House of the House of the House of the House of the House , the House of the House of the House of the House .
, if you want to keep the radio , at least on programs that do not .
they send The Vo@@ ice at a first @-@ rate window of time because they want to achieve the lowest broad support for their future .
the idea that no one else would show this is a joke , it is ridiculous , of course nonsense .
Johnson said : I don &apos;t see why a re@@ gressive tax is financed programs that could be financed without subsidies .
the bird ice is such a program , E@@ ast@@ grandchildren , is another , admittedly both self @-@ productivity .
frankly , other channels would give up their rights .
I am asked to see how this is publicly challenged .
I do not believe that this would actually reduce the BBC .
Johnson , a business businessman who led the Ch@@ ann@@ el 4 of 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC was blamed for ratings , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support .
his comments to sell the BBC &apos;s most popular show . the former head of sk@@ y , the former head of sk@@ y , the former head of sk@@ y , the former head of sk@@ y , the former head of sk@@ y , the former head of sk@@ y , the former head of sk@@ y .
Johnson said that , of course , the more public @-@ minded programs - the no public has to be found . ) , of course , should go to B@@ BC@@ 4 , and they can argue that if they are not measured by the audience , they have been prepared to do so , of course , and they can be able to do so , of course , that no one has seen .
they put them into a window of time in which nobody wanted to see it .
in terms of conditions can get the best value : I urge to find a more re@@ gressive system in terms of conditions that can get the best value to it .
of course , you all think that we all think we all think about 150 per year , but for people who are a lot of money for the $ 150 billion , I wonder whether they do not consume much from the BBC .
the former Sk@@ es and maintain 5 % - the leader of David El@@ stein , who was also told the committee before the committee on service , called for the BBC to review its rice to be able to form and maintain its rice .
radio , he said , said that only the BBC would be able to be classified by the BBC - which he said that it would be 1 % of their TV - and that it should be changed in the public - and maintain an example of this change in the public and Canada - as well as 0.1 % in Australia and Canada .
to the question of the partnerships , the BBC told El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas such as the pro@@ mit@@ ation that he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and to take alliances available to commercial channels to make everything online online .

the video shows how the persistence will change the direction of the moment in which they are punished with K@@ lan@@ ons .
scientists have been created with genetically modified nervous systems .

the researchers said that the story showed the power of a new trial , called P@@ o@@ an &apos;s power to activ@@ ate a series of brain - heart , heart , and muscle - to activ@@ ate cells outside the body .
one day , S@@ re@@ e@@ th C@@ hal@@ as@@ ani , researchers at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , said that the process might one day replace the depths of the steam - the whole way to replace the electrical impulses of people to treat the symptoms of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
in the typically do not respond to ultra @-@ all , but C@@ hal@@ as@@ ani found it when they were surrounded by a liquid @-@ air air bubbles .
bubbles , he found out , increase the ultra @-@ chur@@ waves , which then enter into the worms .
the spread of Ul@@ oc@@ waves are on structures , the TR@@ P Strategy - the International IC@@ I@@ V station , and to be found in the lines of some of the worms .
the pattern of these I@@ combatants and activ@@ ate the cells that they are ordered is a report of Nature .
so C@@ hal@@ as@@ ani genetically changed , C@@ hal@@ as@@ ani genetically changed the worms that some of their prot@@ on@@ ons are TR@@ P - the responsibility of I@@ 4 .
when he uses ultra @-@ eu@@ als to changed cre@@ ats , the spread caused by micro@@ b@@ bs are reinforced , and , in the worms , where they are changing by the altered engines of their pur@@ ons .
the process has made some similarities to the list of options , a ground@@ breaking To@@ ol , which allows scientists to get neurons with stimulus on the lights .
but C@@ hal@@ as@@ ani said that it could have some advantage of this technology .

eight @-@ golden rules for life in students
even more than 11 years ago , I looked as a self @-@ forgotten , still in the belief of Berezovsky and moral relativi@@ sm , but only now I remember . I remember that I have taken - and the numerous , long @-@ suffering complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be dismissed in eight simple rules .
the entry in the number of students is easy to become absolutely terrifying .
it is tempting : people tell where you com@@ com@@ st , whether , whether you are going on , whether you are going on , whether you stand up on cor@@ B@@ n , and why you are asked , because you do not love your love , because you do not love your love , because you have neither love and hate , because you do not love your love , because you have neither love and
breathe you .
and help others to do the same - do you ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ ts the conversation , and helps you to learn the people who don &apos;t speak , even if your che@@ ers were set fire , and that fire of fire would be .
result people . &quot;
ab@@ always turn to people who are often turning into line , but they are also the places where people want to attract and get their subordin@@ es to the right .
in the same way , you do not think about the relationship with a relationship with start start to start with a relationship with start start to start with a relationship with start start to start with a relationship with start start .
gross treatment receive a university treatment .
and it should always be a re@@ b@@ um , but many student skills constitute a space - the drive for development - the cause of power , which is friendly and socially , and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who is trying to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say : I may go you , and I want to leave our friendship , I want to leave the energy that I have spent on the interaction for the interaction .
try to feel when a fellow militant one can be exhausted - and send him a case at work .
thing you do .
a cand@@ l had a cand@@ l in my student return , the idea that a not @-@ designed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
@-@ beating friendship . &quot;
because you are beginning at the height of the recovery .
a good way to close friend@@ ships .
their fellow citizens feel committed to stay , and will at the end of your face at the end of a le@@ ck@@ al surprise .
, of course , this depends on whether you are a decent leg .
thing you are ill @-@ conceived , sugar , and fat cause people to sleep up if you pay .
to steal food is a common crime in the student of students .
of course , it is a theft , of course , but it is the N@@ dd@@ er of a dr@@ w of chicken to your tea ?
check with the Arctic .
the odds are good that they say themselves to service themselves .
if someone added your milk , you try to punish it , but try to try to deal with more than my fellow milk .
it is now in prison .
they should be unable to make the people from sleep or from the work .
it sit not only to be a decent man , but that you belong to the people who are in the glass house .
a girl on the morning had a test .
responded music .
after all , when she heard around 5 @-@ clock , she kept their neighbors to sleep two hours before she left their own music to their own music , killing their door , and begin for their final @-@ time test .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future adul@@ partners happens to enter the same student of the home .
conversely , it would not be a deep thing for your future marriage to return to them for your future marriage , who will have to divide them , and , perhaps and perhaps , how to get all common friends ?
of course , the heart of the heart of the heart is its own paths - but if you are definitely not your future marriage , you try at least trying to tell your under@@ bel@@ b a little reason .
thing seems to be found between an ultra @-@ W and M@@ ob@@ ll .

thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
to know how fast @-@ cost housing can be created : it is building in a project for refugees .
Mr. Gil@@ d@@ ner , many refugees will push for the housing market .
what is the solution ?
thing Gil@@ d@@ ner has no sustainability .
for people remain too big .
in the coming decades , we also need sufficient housing in the coming decades .
a nasty , three @-@ dimensional travel of travel , is the solution .
Gil@@ d@@ ner : a travel drain for the least .
it makes it easier for integration .
this is a different way to do the people .
each of the six houses that are built in the pilot project there are three residential units for each four asylum seekers .
each unit has two bed@@ room , bad , cu@@ che , and an area room .
it may be that many people will say that it is peace , I get back .
then the homes can easily be built into their needs .
how large are the costs ?
Gil@@ d@@ ner : the price of € 160 meters per house is at 18@@ 4 , without land .
is manageable .
six months of construction took place .
that is appropriate .
are the construction rules complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ d@@ ner : construction , I have learned my project .
in particular , it is always complicated that the threat of Dam@@ o@@ o@@ es@@ es@@ es@@ es@@ es@@ va is very complicated , and the rule of a settlement order .
green .
there will be at least three , more , who creates a travel of three homes .
only in the cities are missing .
refugees and asylum seekers have not cars .
how did the An@@ ans have responded to their travelers to travel ?
Gil@@ d@@ ner : there were those who have been accused of creating a luxury built @-@ up of asylum seekers .
what is definitely wrong .
but does not exacerbate the competition for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ d@@ ner : true , we had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but built on luxury homes , which can hardly afford to afford .
my project need the message , including ordinary people .
not only refugees , not just refugees , but also the single mother or the lower income .
I tell how to build today and well .

the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu .
Israel &apos;s continuing settlement activities is critical of the will of Israel &apos;s peace process .
the deal with the deal surrounding the deal with Iran &apos;s nuclear program has worsened the two further further .
in March , Netanyahu had been reluctant to be at invitation to the Republicans of the US Congress - Congress issued a disputed speech , which was part as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not met with Obama , a meeting that was meant to have rejected the upcoming election in Israel .
an emergency call for his friend to have shot up in a emergency call .
in a emergency call , professor Sh@@ co@@ on Lam@@ b was told a somewhat z@@ ci@@ ous voice by the police that he shot his girl@@ friend and that officials would have to come to his house .

he said that Lam@@ b has made the disastrous emergency story to come .
by the end of the day , there was another death : lam@@ m took him when the police denied him .
a day after the shooting at the University who forced students and D@@ oc@@ ators to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still seek to hide a picture of what the lam@@ b were motivated .
the details of both the government &apos;s subjects , as did what students and staff who knew him , helped to show an image of a talented but possibly difficult teachers .

another student , S@@ el Sy@@ ke , said that Lam@@ m told him that he was asking at the end of the academic of 2014 - to do with stress .
Lam@@ b had asked the delta State University to ask for a mere health reasons , saying that he had any health problem .
little just put two online - in the process of only two online .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the pro@@ co@@ ity of the lam@@ b had worked so hard for him to provide a guarantee of an automatic path to a automatic path to a job as an additional stimulus - a professor .
in the meantime , the President William <unk> st said that he wi@@ ars nothing from a conflict between Lam@@ b and Schmidt , but , of course , there was something in a British image .
ab@@ f cannot answer the questions . &quot;
after the flight , the police later saw Lam@@ &apos;s track when he was re@@ planted in Mis@@ si@@ ssi@@ i from Ar@@ can@@ ah .

Secretary @-@ General Ban Ki @-@ Kahn - The Moon says that his response to Russia &apos;s enhanced military support for Syria is : there is no military solution ; there is no military solution ; and more weapons will only worsen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN is asking - for all parties , including the divided UN - Security Council , on which to unite and inclusive negotiations on the process of a political solution .
ban , a press conference on the Middle East , is planning that he plans to meet the foreign minister of the Commission - the United States , Russia , China , the United Kingdom , and France - on the verge of the General Assembly meeting this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
he has been biased that the divisions of the Council and the regional powers are being able to do so .
ban called for the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity that have demonstrated them with Iran in reaching a nuclear deal with Iran .
conspiracy to take seriously is serious .
to be mentioned .
others have dismissed him as a joke .

but , no matter how some Republicans try to draw Donald t@@ der from the top , there is no work ( or ) .

we are too early in the election &quot; is too early .
no one claims that , most likely , the Republican nomination will likely win .
experts stress that when the P@@ ain was asked in 2011 , P@@ P@@ P@@ <unk> &apos;s leadership was found in the process of the rising C@@ ain , which no one state was won in the process .
the point to have a general election .

here are some current numbers numbers suggest that real estate is not only a temporary phase : the natural modus is not only a temporary period :
180 degrees has been around 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald President Donald im his candidacy announced , a poll of Mon@@ ol was a conclusion of the Mon@@ ol - The University of the only two of ten Republicans to be the real estate - the modus Mo@@ gu@@ l , that only two of ten Republicans were the real estate - the modus Mo@@ gu@@ l .
by mid @-@ July , it was 40 % .
52 % was 52 % in early August .
is six .
three of 10 say that they have a negative opinion .
the numbers are in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ ac of the Republicans , the last week , found that 60 % of Republicans have a good opinion of the fact .
two @-@ thirds of the G@@ O@@ P - E@@ O@@ P , G@@ O@@ P , would be happy with a lot of happy than candidates .
the Republicans of the CNN / F@@ C survey 67 % of Republicans , they would either be willing to be classified ; or were being satisfied ; if a threat @-@ by @-@ board would be nominated .
only two of 10 say they would be angry ; if he were the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son creates roughly the same enthusiasm as a divide ( 43 % say , they were &quot; with &quot; 43 % , and are enthusiastic of the cards ; he would be a mere 40 % that is the same thing in the same way ) .
the next thing ?
percent Mar@@ co @-@ and @-@ file street .
on the other hand , 47 % of Republican voters say that they were being unhappy ; or , if the Bush was the favorite , 47 % of the establishment would be a surprise .
a majority of Republicans don &apos;t regard a problem .
while Donald widespread statements is widely criticized for his grandiose and offensive statements , 52 % of the Republicans who voted on the Republicans , who have been criticized for a president , is the right temper@@ ament for a president , as A@@ BC News / Washington Post on Mon@@ day .
the same number is true in the first of the nation &apos;s first executive state , state of state , where the same 52 % of Republicans think that he has a person to be a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ k ac last week .
still , 44 % say that he was not the figure to carry out effective power , and almost six to 10 % say that his temper@@ ament does not go into the White House , the A@@ BC / Post .
Republican voters get accustomed to the idea .
Republican voters are also creating a real difference for real when they put their own to their own people .
when they are asked who is the most likely the G@@ O@@ P - the nomination is said to be the best bet on the report / H@@ C survey of the past week that a survey of CNN / H@@ C was the best bet .
this is a change since the time four from 10 end July , when four of 10 end in July , her money was put down on the Bush .
full disclosure : G@@ O@@ P - the head of the past , the eurozone &apos;s most clearly qu@@ ball , has failed to dominate .
at this point last cycle , four of ten Republicans thought that the nomination would win the nomination only 28 % of the final candidate Mitt Romney .
yet a number of G@@ O@@ P - the campaign of a campaign is that a number of G@@ O@@ P - is understandable .
when Republicans are mounting to impose another candidate .
some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to lead to a strong problem while the anti @-@ Americanism - the threat of the International Monetary Reserve - is more than a dozen other candidates .
in early September , but the head of the country &apos;s head of power - the contest of the Americas - is the contest between the creation and most other Republican candidates , a majority of the support .
he has made 13 points before Mar@@ co @-@ century 13 points , before Mar@@ co @-@ century , before the Bush 15 point , before the brink 15 points , before the end of Paul , and finally , John York , and Chris Big @-@ scale .
it is an head of the game - the head of the responsibility - the head of the game , the head of the game , to the fore of C@@ C@@ z C@@ ru@@ z .
the only candidate that suggests ?
Ben Car@@ son would make the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head - the head of the situation - to surpass the race .
a close majority of Donald fies - the threat of the threat - is to say that they have formed their opinion .
a new poll by CB@@ S / N@@ Y@@ T on the service of the service shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support the partition they say they have given their votes .
to be sure , much can be done to change this , and nobody can never say that they never to change .
46 % said that they are open to lead to other candidates .
yet the strongest competition in the moment of the other outsider , the neur@@ och@@ ent Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say that they have formed their opinion are twice as frequent as they are .
issue are related to immigration .
since Donald t@@ der was launched in his campaign for two months ago , Donald t@@ der immigrants had been drawn out of Mexico from Mexico , and the no@@ pin of public discourse .
some worry that the bombs of bas@@ tic out@@ get is being used by a massive list of key to power - America &apos;s Republican Party will be removed by the Republican Party and the new resistance - to help damage .
but , after the new A@@ BC / Post , six of 10 Republicans said that they agree with a related to issue with the issue of immigration .
control migration in the spotlight , however , is becoming more likely to do .
.
in fact , Donald Car@@ son accounts for roughly half of the support of Republican voters , especially through their outsiders - to be held .
six from 10 Republicans say in the new mon@@ day - The A@@ BC / Post poll , rather than someone else &apos;s political maver@@ ick .
they are angry to Washington .
a poll of D@@ <unk> &apos;s <unk> / Bloomberg two weeks ago shows that three of four of the four cast - Republican Republicans on Republicans in Congress are frustrated by 54 % - are dissatisfied , and 21 % are un@@ connected ; and 21 % are wrong .

the new laws that joined the European Union &apos;s co @-@ Hungary in Hungary make the over@@ qu@@ ven of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ 4 ated - the International Assembly - that the government has built on a crime , and laws also found for a crime , including a higher prison sentence for convicted human traders .

we say it very clear : the illegal border over is a crime .
parliament must agree to the military @-@ force military @-@ style military , which will be expected for next week , but reporters of the Press have heavily engaged on the border with vehicles and H@@ onds for days .
a country &apos;s reputation , a country &apos;s main security for Orban , said that the authorities have already entered 45 &apos;s people at trying to cross the border , 15 others have already been left into the country .
they come through by imposing the fence , now in police custody and are accused of the new laws .
authorities are quick to repair the fence .

choice - Hillary 2016 &apos;s head of Ber@@ nie S@@ different in national poll , hal@@ ved out to 2016 : Hillary Clinton &apos;s head of Ber@@ nie S@@ different in national poll was hal@@ ved by the National poll .
former US , for Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , continues to keep a double @-@ digit margin in the democratic race to the national nomination , but Senator Ber@@ nie no different gains her way to the ground .
Clinton has now received support from 47 % of democratic voters in the primary ( 58 % ) , while S@@ different is second in second , with 27 % ( rising by 17 % ) .
vice President Joe Biden , who has not yet declared whether he is running for the presidency , receives support of 15 % of the Democratic electorate .
more than five months before the start of the primary primary , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinions is what candidates will support them .
President supporters are more consistent than those of the other candidates .
since the CB@@ S has been asking - the News News - Clinton has lost Clinton in a number of demographic groups , while S@@ different gains have been achieved .
Clinton holds a large margin in women and moderates , but that lead has been reduced .
much of them in men , and S@@ different is back to 5 .
the benefit of democratic voters over 50 years has evap@@ orated , and they are now at equal level .
voters .
last month , Clinton was a different @-@ year margin in the liberals , but S@@ different has now turned a 5 @-@ month call for the group .
for half of the democratic electorate , about half of the primary national voters , they would argue that they would support with enthusiasm Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
it would support some of them with some prerogatives , and only support another 15 % .
six percent would not support them .
now is enthusiastic of the current supporters .
views are more likely to support the views of those who currently support Clinton - only about a quarter , for example - for about a quarter .
while 48 % of the popular electorate in the primary say say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , so Republican voters have received this more than their top candidate , Donald <unk> ( 35 % ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question , why are they want to see the right , but the most common answer is that it is time to see a woman ( 13 % ) , and that it is the best candidate for the job ( 10 % ) .
the Clinton &apos;s supporters , too , is mentioned with Bill Clinton ( 9 % ) .
order to deal with problems and voting will be quoted .
since Vice President is holding a potential for the presidency to the presidency , 57 % of the Democratic electorate will want to see him in the race - though one @-@ third believes that he should not do it .
when democratic voters are asked to the Party , who would be their second choice , is a for@@ top of the top .
that , a second election is far from S@@ different .
if Biden chooses to run out of the Democrats , Hillary Clinton &apos;s head of S@@ different , from 20 points , is raised with Biden on 30 points without him .
twenty @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chance to win , but this figure has fallen from 78 % last month .
Biden is a second @-@ sum game , but the percentage that it has been considered to be the most than the most one @-@ than @-@ one @-@ than @-@ one @-@ to @-@ date ; is rising .
nevertheless , when asked what is more important , Democratic voters call questions about voting .
similarly , no single democracy candidate or potential candidate for these voters is proving unacceptable .
Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results in a few important features of their party &apos;s primary Party .
strong and more leadership is being honest and credible and rewarded with strong leadership .
, for the three candidates .
thirty percent of democratic voters believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy , twice as many say the more than 15 % ( 15 % ) , but 27 % have no opinion of him .
democratic voters in general view Clinton , S@@ different , and Biden , in con@@ formity with their views .
on all of these measures .
because questions about Hillary Clinton &apos;s use of an individual E - the desperate question of being - and to be tried as Secretary of State during the tenure as Secretary of State , most Democratic voters are satisfied with their explanation , saying that it does not affect their views on the whole .
but it is a different story in America &apos;s public as a whole .
one @-@ third is satisfied .
public opinion was divided in March , just after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the E - the desperate controversy - has no effect on her overall opinions of Clinton , though 36 % said that her opinion has deteriorated from her .
it is mostly Republicans , more than six to 10 , that their views of Clinton have become worse .
although Clinton is perceived to be honest and trustworthy by voters &quot; voters , this remains a problem for them under a single @-@ minded voters : only 32 % see it as honest and credible , eight % less than last month and 15 points less since May .

Fed will be allowed to do so if the Fed increases interest rates .
interest rates is coming , and homeowners will fal@@ ter , returns on bonds will rise , and the economy will become mired in recession .
we know that .
we do not know how long it will last .
and , in particular , history is limited to the economy .
interest @-@ rate increases were followed by a second @-@ rate hike , a recession occurred within just 11 months after the first rate of interest @-@ rate hikes and lasted .
the Federal Reserve &apos;s aggressi@@ veness is often , if not always , one factor , as the economy and financial assets respond .
as a result , US officials have been reluctant to emphasize the US &apos;s failure to raise interest rates , but rather on the period that norm@@ alizes .
indeed , several variables play a part .
ended hike may be exaggerated .
and , as the Fed &apos;s first increase since the global financial crisis , the first increase in the Fed since the global financial crisis is inevitably attributed to an end to the end of the era of the era ; the money , said , and be interpreted ; read , the economist of Capital Economics , said in a university citizen .
by contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of the US - to borrow too normal , but still at low levels to fear the rest of the game that many seem to fear .
absence no longer will have a impact .
historical trends could respond .
as the market has seen in the past month , the pre @-@ alignment of raising hikes can be volatile for a while .
influence is less dramatic .
moreover , there seems to be a tendency that asset @-@ saving yields will be spent 12 @-@ 24 months after the first increase , which may have been deferred in monetary policy , and perhaps again , the central monetary policy , to the ECB , which is , to put back to delay in a recent study what is happening to rate hikes in the Fed .
more precisely , the market has been mostly flat in the past 35 years - about 14 % - on the way to the rate hike , a close @-@ rate , and , indeed , the next 35 days , according to a current analysis of the past six past past cycles of Nu@@ ve@@ en asset management , the D@@ <unk> , the bar@@ ron , and a published .
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on stocks tend to come in the wake cycle , and the rate of return starts to decline .
to encourage economic life .
in the current case , the Fed faces some conditions that could not have been before and that could accelerate a recession .
what is highly remarkable is that GDP will be near its lowest rate at interest rates in the Fed &apos;s interest rate .
the second 18 rate rate since 1950 , the 1@@ 18 rate rate since 1950 was below 4.5 % .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 % , few expect that this will last , and expect only 1.5 % for the third quarter .
interest rates in so fragile economic vulnerabilities could be risky , raising the question of whether this time is different , and the Deutsche Bank said .
market participants have been prepared to raise the Fed rate of the Fed , and all eyes were at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on the United Kingdom &apos;s Federal Open Market Committee on the scene that ends on the D@@ urs@@ day .
while many strategists and economists believe that the &quot; B@@ M@@ C &quot; might approve a hike in this meeting , the futures - if trade is only one 25 % probability .
&quot; in our study , all recent cycles cycles from 1950 to the present @-@ day &quot; s &quot; - the cycle of the situation , and , in the face of the recovery , has taken a sharp rec@@ li@@ li@@ li@@ li@@ li@@ li@@ li@@ li@@ li@@ li@@ li@@ li@@ li@@ li@@ li@@ li@@ li@@ li@@ ler very quickly after the start began to the onset of recovery .
by contrast , this is a clear slow recovery , which was the worst recession in the interwar period .
the current cycle is far the longest , which the Fed has been going to have since the last recession , and the record was 35 months , and so far has been 74 months .
it was also volatile , because the market is becoming an interest rate , and the pattern is quite similar to capital markets .
the main difference is that the impact of bonds is faster than stocks when their strategic course are changing .
with bonds , yields seem to shift to change once the first increase in the cycle comes in the cycle .
&quot; the ban@@ w@@ ning cycle falls down , &quot; said the Germans .
as strategists of Charles gays believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to a closer @-@ and @-@ off @-@ off @-@ off @-@ off @-@ off @-@ off @-@ off @-@ off @-@ off bond and lead to a decrease in its curve .
often , high @-@ rate bonds often yield better returns in such a climate , though we are still careful to expect higher returns , said K@@ <unk> Jones , Fi@@ en@@ an , Fi@@ w@@ ning , - the most efficient , p@@ st@@ ing , and - the most efficient , p@@ st@@ ing , and , in a analysis , the p@@ st@@ n of the Exchequer .
interesting , then , that markets already have a Fed - the strategy of fiscal expectations - have adjusted for the Fed to adjust .
but the market &apos;s strength and the decline in inflationary expectations gives some signs that the market has adjusted to tighter monetary policy , they wrote .
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the road @-@ off is flat , credit , and volatility has risen , and volatility has risen - all of the market , if the Fed aggrav@@ ates its strategy .
large and all , companies that would make the larger share of their business activities in the US will benefit when interest rates rise and local products more attractive .
multinational companies with large debt are worse off , as a rising dollar makes their products more costly to the global market , and as well as funding their debt .
moreover , history shows that quality - quality - stocks tend to respond to a positive rate after five months after initial rate hike , Goldman Sachs , Goldman Sachs , and the biggest analysts in a report for customers .
firms with a strong record of public interest rates , with a weak record , have exceeded 5 percentage points after each of the rate of interest rates in 1994 , 1999 , and 2004 .
high capital is high - and , with low capital , their shares exceeded their counterparts , with low @-@ quality quality at average ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will be a big problem .
, even lose , have said .
consumer @-@ run games are also benefiting by consumers .
savers could see profits by higher returns , even when experts are different , how fast .

according to the head of Robert Ri@@ ff@@ el , the defendants were emerging in 2006 that the defendants were used to spend money from the United States accounts in 2006 to 2011 , for which they were allowed to provide their functions to the private purposes .

why the payment was not heard in a place had been shown in a way of the cover , the judge Justice .
the cover of not interested in the details of financial intermediation , important to do so is the answer .
when the official investigation began to pay a man of last year , a figure was reported to be reported by $ 1@@ 20,000 euros on the club account in 2011 .
these are saving , the defendants said .
this securities account went on the names of the second accused , and was that it was not known .
&quot; ? &quot;
the answer was not .
the best of it .
if he happened , nobody would have known something of this money , the prosecutor was allowed to be in the room .
complicity was informed , the official official was justified .
, that over@@ allocation was re@@ stated .
the damage was well @-@ conceived ?
the first defendants said that he didn &apos;t agree with this formulation because the lack of never was damage .
but what is to me when the lawyer says : &quot; the man is the ones who you are all from the hook .

this was reflected the Med@@ ley of tax - the main culprit - the threat of the world - the threat of the world - the threat of the world - the threat of so@@ ra@@ ra@@ ff , telephone - and the pseudo @-@ waste of non @-@ performing - the most of the most of our large newspapers .
hot Gore &apos;s is distributed in a cage that distra@@ us@@ yed him rather than his fellow day and to be on his turn .
indeed , more than the Blair of the fact was more than Blair himself , as Blair himself was to be a recall of Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Blair had not asked the principle of the EU Constitution , which then turned from French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which was then opposed to his back door .
he never abandoned him .
but the bar@@ ter Jer@@ e Cor@@ B@@ n , who was in the back of Mon@@ day Day at the Mon@@ day , told him that he had no time to waste me to waste - seems to repeat the fact that the &quot; N@@ O@@ cin@@ &quot; Fo@@ de @-@ no@@ ed , the most 80 @-@ year @-@ old Washington &apos;s strategy - he will now be repeating a mistake then and now .
it may take a coherent strategy to win the media , but it is certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC Monetary - if he is to leave the media .
Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s &apos;s official position to Europe is - I &apos;m friendly - in the development .
we should remain in a reformed EU .
now , outside of U@@ dy@@ y traditional f@@ um@@ s@@ ar@@ s@@ an , most people outside of U@@ dy@@ s@@ ar@@ ur , the country &apos;s tendency and wild f@@ ys - a seduc@@ tive English , the country &apos;s sp@@ ys - is likely to say any yes .
it is what aid is required , one Ben@@ n , but no Ben@@ c of the radio and television in radio and television , said that he was fought in his radio , not admit that Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s &apos;s appointment of provocative John Mc@@ D@@ t@@ &apos;s &apos;s appointment was a bad idea .
it reminded me to the 70 @-@ level of 70 - he was a year for years , when his old father sought to be dis@@ loyal to his Labour , to his prime father to be dis@@ loyal to his Labour - the main cabinet to his or lose his cabinet .
aid for the fight was even more attractive .
but , to fight for what Mc@@ D@@ ell , the J@@ C , still had his fellow combatants and legislators after all reports on their clause on Mon@@ day day .
whatever the high @-@ handed nature of the economy - the International image of Cor@@ B@@ n - is to think that he has even done me - think that he has even done me - and , in the era of the soci@@ al media , a breeding ground of paranoia and betrayal .
it is right to give Cameron out free card for Europe who allows him to keep Lab@@ support for granted to a war , as Mc@@ D@@ ell .
Simon J@@ ew is sure to think about this .
but Mc@@ D@@ t@@ ell and Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s &apos;s fundamental added contribution to the EU - for membership - is a matter of es@@ om@@ ic discussion of leftist dissidents , for whom the nar@@ cis@@ si@@ sm of the small difference is a central principle of dogmatic disputes .

experts criticize the report of Public Health England on e @-@ sum .
claims of government @-@ funded agency that em@@ eling the disease was not less damaging than smoking was produced from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( B@@ M@@ J ) write up in a series by asking the public Health England ( PTAs ) , in their report on the issue of the Public Health England ( PTAs ) .
the &quot; board &quot; issued on the &quot; board &quot; of the last month , and describes him as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
but some researchers have challenged the resilience of data and had been to have been pointed out to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
a editorial in the medical journal last month , the country &apos;s &quot; extremely &quot; A month struck the &quot; extraordinarily w@@ factory basis &quot; on which the PTAs established its most important conclusion .
two other researchers write into B@@ M@@ Y and have asked whether the claims goes to the &quot; haves &quot; on either or sand .
Martin Mc@@ Ke@@ e , professor for European Public pri@@ cs in the London School of Hy@@ giene and Tro@@ p@@ <unk> , and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , professor for L@@ ste@@ am@@ <unk> University of Li@@ ver@@ pool , said : A fundamental principle of public health is that policies should be based on the evidence of effectiveness .
they said that the public expects the argument that the current best estimate is that the current best estimate is that the current best estimate is to use the fact that the issue is to use - the equivalent of 95 % less damaging than smoking on drugs , on a detailed review of the difference and Mo@@ del@@ fication of Mo@@ del@@ li@@ fication .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were called to develop a model for a added speci@@ criteria - the <unk> A - the International Academy of Economic <unk> - the meeting of the meeting was published in a research report .
Mc@@ Ke@@ e and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsors of the meeting was a firm called euro Health Health , whose chief director was supposed to be paid by British American official official funds ( asked ) for an independent study .
he also signed the credentials of asked for public health in a sustainability report , said they .
one of the 12 participants told the meeting , means of an e @-@ bailout - aid to cigarettes - to preserve the highest , but not funding that he should receive on the tobacco companies Philip sively used to have received the tobacco companies that they have received on reports of tobacco companies .
the reasons for the members of the body &apos;s members will not be met , but it includes several well @-@ known em@@ ves - the desperate to provide the assistance - to provide a group of the kind of a industries that some industries - including industries - to fund them .
some other participants at the meeting are not known for their know of their know - the country &apos;s tobacco control .
the meeting took on tobacco , the head of the executive is also being included .
the group &apos;s research work is telling , significantly , that there is a shortage of severe evidence for most products &quot; most criteria on most criteria ; there are , Mc@@ Ke@@ e and Cap@@ e@@ well .
attacks not of these links or constraints on the part of the US@@ E will be to be addressed .
the evidence of the type of e @-@ making is that it is no evidence that it is to use the e of the e - to provide the cigarettes for the cigarettes , as a way to smoking for children or un@@ un@@ paid .
Pro@@ f of the Exchequer of the Health and well @-@ being at the staff , said that the claims of B@@ M@@ Y was already responded before .
he said : e cigarettes are far less damaging than smoking .
every second lifetime smokers die in his addiction .
any evidence suggests that the health risk of E is being destroyed - the amount of cigarettes are small compared to them , but that we continue to have long @-@ term effects .
the public E has the clear duty to know the public about what is proving to prove proof , and what is not , especially when there is a lot of public confusion about relative perils relative to tobacco .
nearly 80,000 people die each year on a disease , and smoking costs two billion dollars per year .
we do not meet our national jurisdiction by clear pre @-@ evidence that it is caused .

former President of Ch@@ Z@@ el &apos;s 4 , Lu@@ ke Johnson , who said that the BBC should stop using programs like E@@ ast@@ i@@ des and The Vo@@ ice , said that commercial rivals would be able to do so ; the H@@ it is asking , as he is the case of the Second e So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the TV was used only to make the kind of programs that cannot be dealt with other UK .
he criticized the BBC that they publicly asked to provide publicly - the legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard disputed periods of protests , and broadcast like B@@ BC@@ 4 .
after the BBC is the world &apos;s largest director , the world &apos;s director director , Tony H@@ all , the company said more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he had tried for six years at Cheney &apos;s prison , and has tried for six years to come to the BBC .
I have been going on , I have problems with the idea that the BBC has been in mission , or send to the upper house of the BBC , and is sending the upper house - the main house of the House - the International Committee - the International Committee - the International Committee , which is the subject of the BBC &apos;s future .
when you want to keep the TV , I should not be able to make your output at least on programs that do not do , or to mandate .
they send The Vo@@ ice in a first @-@ rate window of time because they want to achieve the lowest of the future for their future .
the idea that no one else would show this is a joke , of course nonsense .
Johnson said : I don &apos;t see how a re@@ gressive tax funding programs financed , which could be financed without subsidies .
the bird ice is such a program , E@@ ast@@ ent@@ ent@@ ders , another , admittedly both of their productivity .
the honestly would be put right .
we can be publicly asked to see it . &quot;
not I think that would reduce the BBC .
Johnson , a entrepreneur of S@@ ain@@ , who headed the Ch@@ ann@@ el 4 of 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC was blamed for ratings , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support .
his comments to the most popular S@@ am@@ sis of the BBC have been saying that , as former head of sk@@ y , the former head of sk@@ y , the former head of sk@@ y , the former head of sk@@ y , the former head of sk@@ y , the former head of sk@@ y , the former head of sk@@ y , suggested that the BBC should sell a mi@@ w like E@@ ast@@ ent@@ En@@
Johnson said that the sooner public @-@ welfare - the legal N@@ ical - of the Americas , the legal N@@ ian Strategy - should be able to do so , and they can &apos;t measure their tasks , and they can argue if they are not measured at their hypocritical missions to justify 4 billion of people at the expense of 4 billion , and they can argue if they have seen the audience to be paid to the
they are showing a window of time in which nobody wanted to see it .
to the ro@@ sing , Johnson said that I urge to find a more re@@ gressive system on terms that can be paid to the best value .
of course , you think everyone , think that one of 150 per year is a great value , but for people who are money for the 150 billion spent , I wonder whether they are not much from the BBC .
the former Sk@@ y@@ y@@ --and and Ch@@ Z@@ el 5 - the leader of David El@@ stein , who was also saying the committee of the paper , called that the BBC had asked their rice to be able to provide its rice - the mission of the day , and to inform , and maintain .
he said that only the BBC &apos;s only BBC - had now been able to be officially classified as a education - to provide 1 % of their TV - and to do so - and to do so - and to do so in public - and to say it in public - and say , the public @-@ sponsored TV television in Australia and Canada .
the new States said more in areas like the Pro@@ an@@ er that he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and to make alliances to make all online online .

it still is clear that anyone who wants a asylum @-@ seeking alternative , which can be taken on , of course .
people &apos;s supply and security are at the fore .
but it is clear that there are strong signals , and the ministerial minister said .
people must know that we do not accept vulnerable migration flows , including the Au@@ str@@ ess of the Americas - the only @-@ fledged of the Americas .
it needs a controlled approach .
and , in the absence of Cor@@ ri@@ dor ; Slovenia refuses to reject Slovenia .
the Cro@@ an government had previously been told , including Slovenia , and continue to travel to Austria and Germany , and may also build cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
this is what happened to the Minister of Interior Minister V@@ es@@ na &apos;s Z@@ ni@@ na &apos;s Z@@ ni@@ na &apos;s Z@@ ni@@ na &apos;s Z@@ ni@@ na &apos;s Z@@ ni@@ na &apos;s Z@@ ni@@ na &apos;s Z@@ ni@@ na .
the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is totally unacceptable ; Slovenia is intensify the surveillance of the border - especially Hungary - intensify .
Croatia is heavily controlled as an external margin .
as the ministerial minister pointed out , Sloven@@ es is not to abandon his borders .
so , by the EU &apos;s rejection of the EU , it must &apos;t work its commitments ; otherwise the system cannot work ; it emphasized the system &apos;s decision .
as the Cro@@ an government told , the first refugees had already tried to serve in the after@@ hours , in eastern Cro@@ ati@@ en on border over the road to the Council .
inter@@ @-@ generation the Cro@@ b police could take them in the near @-@ fields fields .

in the coming days of view , his country has been around 4,000 refugees , said Prime Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ ast@@ j@@ ic .
bro@@ n@@ ship had brought the Hungarian border to Croatia , the country &apos;s border , the country &apos;s , and Serb media .
but the government in Belgrade &apos;s government , however , denied that it is the people who are seeking to go to certain routine : neither can we , we want to do so ; it was meant .

&quot; we have one of the fact that Hungary has made it , so the police said that we should go to the point , said of the refugees .
travel , they wanted to travel to Germany , Slovenia , and Austria .
indeed , it may now be able to see the predicted @-@ cut shift in the Balkans - Turkey &apos;s path to create - Georgia &apos;s Central - Monetary integration - the Central War - the Central War - the Central Hung@@ arians - and to make Hungary a somewhat more Western @-@ style Hungary .

Croatia &apos;s Minister minister of O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously emphasized that his country has prepared plans for the case of a strong influx of refugees to be prepared for possible exceptional situations .

tight controls to qualify for membership in the sheep area .
Slovenia is part of this since 2007 , the EU has provided a good illustration of what the standard of border controls is the same since 2007 .

according to media reports , they would have spent the past night on the border over the fall of dreams that have been spent after R@@ e@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border over@@ co@@ ding dreams and B@@ ci@@ i Bre@@ g continued to be completely closed .
if the remaining refugees are to continue to travel on the Cro@@ l border , it is not yet clear .
the Serbian minister of Ne@@ bo@@ j@@ sa St@@ y@@ y@@ vi@@ c tried to calm down at a local eye shine in horror , and he is making the debate over @-@ alternative @-@ type street routes after the Hungarian border is now closed .
it would not be very large in the world .
you cannot say whether they would continue their journey about Hungary , Croatia , or a different country .
@-@ like routes routes .
but private @-@ starved workers have already begun to distribute the refugees of land cards where alternative routes are revealed by Croatia .
the border between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border , there are still not a g@@ apped @-@ edge plant .

the central bank has a double mandate of Congress : maximizing the US - employment and prices - is stable .
but , since the Great Recession , the Fed has recognized leaders that there are an unwritten third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the first place of the X - a factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict it . it is the most famous that the US is going to be able to predict , from the unprecedented incentive to be reconciled by the near zero @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .

there is no consensus about what the Fed will do , which is spreading to themselves .
for example , half of the economists who recently been asked by Bloomberg have predicted this week .
financial markets , however , expect a Fed wait to show a key indicator that is only one 30 % chance of an increase .
this suggests a drop in the stock market , if the Fed increases the raising the phrase , because it promises that it is far removed from the blow to the blow by promising another increase far .
on the Dow , the Dow dropped 2@@ 2@@ 8.@@ 89 , or around 1.4 % to 16@@ .@@ 5@@ 9@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the Fed has been asking - the Fed &apos;s policy set in this week &apos;s week , said John London &apos;s chief economist at Moody &apos;s &quot; Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
it would be surprising if the Fed would raise rates at this point ; he said .
if it does , she would have to go very far in their Declaration to calm financial markets , lest them to panic .
other experts argued that the rate hike would calm financial markets , because it will eliminate uncertainty about when the Fed will act .
even a month ago , the Fed seemed to raise the way to raise the rate of 0.@@ 25 percentage points earlier this month , the first small step in a slow tightening of the monetary conditions that would test the strength of the recovery in the US .
Y@@ ern@@ had the spring and early summer that they were in this year , despite the complaints of liberals that more economic progress would be needed , a rise in the price .
although job creation slowed in August , improving the labor market was solid this year .
unemployment fell to 5.@@ 1 % last month , the lowest since more than seven years and near the Lev@@ ration that the Fed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and , while inflation has consistently been at the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the Fed was asking - and the Fed has been asking - that the main reason was far lower oil prices .
the economy is going to be addressed , and it will require them for the labor market , and , I@@ an &apos;s for@@ son , I@@ an &apos;s for@@ son , the chief economist at the pan@@ the@@ on , was a guide .
but financial markets , indeed , have turned out last month around the world , after China devalued its currency .
the Dow Jones average fell by more than 16 % in May , when investors feared that a slowdown in China &apos;s economy would slow global growth .
this month , something has recovered a bit this month , with the Dow now accounting at nearly 10 % below the H@@ oke of May .
for the Fed , market turbulence influence the complex cal@@ bility of when interest rates should be raised .
moreover , if events in financial markets and the news about the weakness of China &apos;s economy were not appeared in the last few weeks , it would have been in the US meeting , and , in the past few weeks , the policy meeting would be the policy of the game , said Stephen D. O@@ <unk> , the Sen@@ <unk> Research fields on L@@ L@@ A Z@@ im@@ an Center for the real E@@ ter@@ se and
now he says that it will wait at least a month to tackle the impact of better .
there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US will be - the economy , and there is almost no reliable data that is what developments in China are described ; &quot; O@@ ther . &quot;
the health of the world economy is none of the central economy , so it should not be involved in its decision @-@ making .
the world &apos;s monetary authority has become the world &apos;s currency agency .
the central bank &apos;s influence has been enormously in recent years .
the mere evidence of then @-@ in @-@ then Ben Bernanke &apos;s then @-@ in @-@ 2013 Ben Bernanke &apos;s &quot; then &quot; that the Fed could be removed its monetary expansion ; it could cause the contagion around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined , the Fed can be expected to monitor them not only to others in other areas , but also to other central banks and experts to maintain a better understanding of the global economy .
their decision @-@ making is more tru@@ er ; more art than science , said Z@@ ach@@ ary of the global strategy for the creation of the firm En@@ .@@ IN@@ C .
Jeffrey L@@ u@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Justice V@@ a , observed that the Fed has been a history of to@@ ges to financial markets - the leading to the movements that apparently not with economic fundamentals .
L@@ w@@ er , the Federal Open Market Committee , de @-@ term , de @-@ prime @-@ policy decisions , in 1998 @-@ 1999 , as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia has brought the Fed to cut its policy rate rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three meetings , despite limited implications for growth in the US ;
a year later , the Fed made the Fed to reverse these cuts .
the Fed should place the aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis like the market crash of 2008 , the &quot; one was told the first place , &quot; Adam P@@ sen , the former member of the Committee on the Bank of England .
the recent turmoil comes from the scene , he said .
you certainly want to be in the situation , when markets are going to throw up , and , if you are going into the situation , Po@@ sen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the Federal Reserve Act is still the dual mandate , and does not mention financial stability , and it does not mean that it should be expected to come ahead .

ab@@ Wo@@ od persists in his light to the Fin@@ al day on the Th@@ al day , his Li@@ g@@ ls is firmly firmly established .
all three women have turned out to be heard about the perfect way of the perfect man , and , in terms , the perfect death of the perfect man , and n@@ er@@ ted his sense of hum@@ or , ambition , family values , and positive attitudes as reasons why they like to be his partner .
but when the question is asked , if you are asked , you could become the spoil@@ er who won the heart of the house .
the same quickly , the main fields and Mark@@ o@@ ski , quickly called both quick - except for themselves - M@@ p@@ ay , as best , is at Wo@@ od@@ ine .
, and Sam Wo@@ od have had a simple relationship .
at the moment when I noted and show that I observed ( Sar@@ r ) and S@@ ams energies , I noted that they were pretty compatible , and I observed that they were pretty compatible , and I have been thought to be the whole course of the S@@ how , said , by Y@@ av@@ ons , the main fields .

the benefits of weight loss of opportunity for slightly over @-@ weight people with the type of 2 diabetes can take at least five years after a new study .
it is too early to say whether easily over @-@ weight people with diabetes on the weight of losing life are longer living for the longer than those who do not have to do so - when they are not asked - for surgical treatment .
in fact , the data of the world &apos;s long time to show a bit of weight , said Dr. Finance Blackstone , a expert of weight loss - the Ch@@ ge@@ gy of the Americas - The Ch@@ ge@@ gy , which wrote a editorial to the new study in J@@ A@@ MA Sur@@ <unk> .

for years , A@@ di@@ sh of their own - and managing surgery to treat the type of type - - the International Monetary Fund - has been a efficient , but most studies have been conducted in humans , the disease , and most studies have been carried out by the disease , the disease , and the higher @-@ powered M@@ ass ( B@@ M@@ I ) .
B@@ M@@ I , some degree of weight in size , is as normal between 18@@ 5 and 2@@ 4.@@ 9 .
a B@@ M@@ I of 25 or more shows that someone is over@@ weight , and people with a B@@ M@@ I are more than 30 .
you can base your B@@ M@@ I : 1,@@ us@@ a@@ .@@ go@@ v and 1@@ 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers of Taiwan &apos;s M@@ im - E@@ eng General J@@ data , which has been conducted since 2007 , and compare two types of A@@ di@@ sh - the Ch@@ gen@@ y and Ma@@ gen@@ y - the disease - the International Monetary @-@ Building ari@@ --@@ is the equivalent of a total - $ 2 - the man of medical and Ma@@ gen@@ y - the source of medical treatment - the
the average B@@ M@@ I , which included this operation , fell from 31 to 2@@ 4.5 to the end of the fifth anniversary of the fifth year .
meanwhile , the B@@ M@@ I remained on those who do not stand - This surgery - surgery &apos;s surgery , and , roughly at 29 , the B@@ M@@ I remained 29 , at a rate of 29 , at 29 , at a 29 rate of 29 @-@ 29 .
among those who undergo surgery surgery , 36 % of diabetes has been growing - the disease illness is completely totally and at 28 % .
the most medical , the treated group , triggered only one percent of total diabetes , and partly for only about 2 % .
moreover , the controls of the blood pressure , the Tri@@ y@@ y@@ c@@ dro@@ de and the &quot; no &quot; thing ; the L@@ D@@ L - Ch@@ <unk> into the general is better in the pre @-@ faire ; group , the authors found out .
researchers also monitored patients - the con@@ 1@@ c cor@@ in@@ ity of her@@ mo@@ an , which reflects blood @-@ bearing levels over time .
I is at the highest rate of A@@ 1@@ c , is the best below 7 % , and is to write the researchers .
after the operation , the average per capita level of her@@ 1@@ c levels has been roughly 6 % .
.
but that better is better than the low @-@ speed control of the day - how you reflect in the improved gra@@ ity of A@@ 1@@ c levels - reduced not the mortality of the birth in five years , including the top scientist Dr. Chi@@ h - Ch@@ Ch@@ eng - Ch@@ Ch@@ eng - Ch@@ Ch@@ eng and his colleagues .
average results have been reported at the two kinds of sur@@ ge@@ ge@@ ge@@ gy .
in the fifth year , the B@@ yp@@ ass of Central - Ch@@ ge@@ gy - The <unk> <unk> gy of the Americas , the country &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> --@@ has lost more weight ( 7.@@ 4 ) , compared to the host of the host of the host of the host of the host of the host of the host of the country &apos;s gas , and a total cut ( 3.1 % ) , and a total
while the new study has no survival advantage of the Ch@@ ge@@ gy of the Ch@@ ge@@ gy of the past five years , there is evidence of a study more than more serious people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says the University of Arizona , college of P@@ ho@@ x .
in Sweden &apos;s study , it was in the most people who have been a a@@ di@@ sh of Japan - surgery , about 29 % less likely to die over 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods .
although the new study does not benefit the survival of the ch@@ ge@@ gy of the Ch@@ ge@@ gy , the patient said that it was reassuring for people with a B@@ M@@ I , under 35 , who are interested in the trial .
what is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation in this low B@@ M@@ I - the largest group is a lower group of the death , without risking the death of death or kidney disease , she said .
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously once the patient is between 27 and 30 .
I think that we are too long waiting to get people to take this seriously , they said .
I think that once they have given these genetic changes , which have linked their bodies to obesity and diabetes , a reversal is really difficult to be .

&quot; The jury is always back again - I have not heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about R@@ ing@@ ti@@ ti@@ ze , &quot; than she 24 us : 2 , he said B@@ iter &apos;s bo@@ g .
I can guarantee that we have not changed the system of our defensive system or the techniques , but in the past six weeks we have made our contact with a real focus , and that has produced us the turnaround .
Tr@@ ent is now in the past three years , and he has apparently a great team , and he is unlikely to train a great team .

he has been compared to his game on Satur@@ day day , with our death at the time night , and how to do it ; the B@@ iter &apos;s y was a for@@ eg@@ y .
I remember that George W. George W. George W. George W. 2010 was criticized , and W@@ ay@@ ne said that he would care about a li@@ e .
but now he has a team that can play and we look as exciting , particularly his young players with their speed .
it is the game game that you want to play .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play his kind of football - not every team , two players , such as Czech ony Mil@@ ford and Ben H@@ <unk> , that they can play as they can play .
I build trust on because they say this things because they are a bit worried about playing to play .
six weeks ago , they probably did not think of us when it was the Big ones .
B@@ iter am@@ y pointed out that the game played an overall outcome against the &quot; game &quot; than the G@@ on@@ sian case against Cow@@ w@@ .
the game of the B@@ ron@@ es was probably a good game , I have not yet been seen , but what was the result ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts at our game , but is the real game ?
so is a little exciting ?

back Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : we create the &quot; one ; &quot;
the influx of immigrants is a huge challenge - the German Chancellor is determined to address them .
regard is Germany ?
around 800 of asylum seekers to Germany &apos;s domestic minister , after Germany , Germany &apos;s prime minister , according to Deputy economist , is a position of the German minister , after the German minister of Si@@ g@@ ler Si@@ g@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even capable of joining a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) , given the unusual challenge of determination : I say and again again : we can do this , and we can create it .
Germany &apos;s role is like the following over@@ consideration .
what is needed is the various @-@ fold forecast of 3@@ 3@@ a ( estimate of the federal R@@ Office ) and the 17@@ 0@@ th ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el - the P@@ est@@ el Institute - the P@@ est@@ el Institute - the P@@ est@@ el Institute - the next five years .
now now is built &quot; ( 25@@ 0@@ 0,000 homes ) .
the lack of housing , particularly at affordable , is a year of the bottom line , especially at affordable and low @-@ cost mix : a year of $ 1,000 to 800,000 social @-@ income homes , and these are particularly favorable housing for refugees .
in addition , the Irish Minister of State General Minister General a H@@ end@@ ri@@ <unk> ( SPD ) wants to double , which is currently 5@@ 18 million to a billion euros .
too little is the point of the P@@ est@@ el - the International Institute : 80 @-@ of @-@ day 8,000 of the annual world would have to be created , and that would have to invest a boost to $ 6.@@ 4 billion per year .
in the way , scientists and federal @-@ minded efforts are in fact that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in housing .
according to the Institute of labor @-@ market and professional research , it is expected to assume that 55 % of the dreaded in Germany will be in the short @-@ term .
but the refugees would not be systematically asked for their skills to help them up , and Clau@@ dia , the project of integration , and education in Ber@@ ter@@ ony - the foundation of the Financial Security Council .
get the way of refugees is crucial to the integration of refugees .
work is the key to social contacts , for which there is a chance of the absor@@ bers &apos;s absor@@ ber , but also for self @-@ esteem of immigrants , the migration of migration tells the di@@ et@@ rich throne .
in Germany , the political turnaround has given a political change : from the authorities banned from labor to refugees to get work .
while it was used to ban asylum seekers from the five to five years , this November 2014 was reduced to three months , just as the Re@@ c@@ cy of the asylum , which limits asylum seekers to a residential site .
in society , even because of the technical community , the government has been given that refugees will have more quickly to be allowed to improve access to the labor force .
obstacles to the labor market is a lack of a kind of under@@ service .
no amount to supply general and professional @-@ related language is still available .
in the most common way , are the most often mediated by personal contacts .
the development of networks is therefore the royal path to work integration .
the Berlin School has found that few people have only caught their children in the S@@ als , an estimated 10 @-@ 15 % : the ab@@ ans &apos;s cut parents are only very important to hold the family , says , the country &apos;s lower parents , says , says , indeed , the family , says , and , indeed , the family , for youth and family in the Berlin &apos;s the Berlin &apos;s .
yet to convince the family , the administration is distributed in different languages .
if the need to attract the workforce of attraction by the large number of refugees is rising , the Berlin Senate would seek to increase educational capacity - say , by allowing more skilled schools .
little service is prepared in countries without a lack of their own devices .
but they are not always educated by a full @-@ educated faculty and teachers , but , as in Berlin , the teachers who have only a single quality in English as a second @-@ language .
there is no shortage of any shortage , says Be@@ th@@ der &apos;s top of the Berlin school administration .
, about 20 % of refugees in Germany want to study .
no state , in principle , prohibited asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception , interior , Frank Hen@@ cle ( CDU ) , has given his position .
learned refugees could be made easier .
for refugees with an entry of return or tolerance , no benefit to the asylum @-@ rate bill is more than a study begin .
the latter is basically not a b@@ af@@ g , because they are not going to fall under the circle of ordinary people .
patient refugees had to have lived so far four years in Germany , to be a be@@ af@@ g of the problem , from January 1 , 2016 , and reached this 15 @-@ month
this funding gap must be closed , but it calls for St@@ ain@@ es , Ber@@ l@@ s State secretary for science , and the Germans of student .
the students should get br@@ af@@ g .
Islam will matter a more important role in determining , because many refugees are Muslims , and for many reasons , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should put to Islam , and the existing state - desperate churches - is pressing to a new state - the country &apos;s right to develop - and the existing state - to create a new state - to create the country &apos;s religions .
it is important to the establishment of an Islamic welfare group that does be professional to newcomers .
the right includes responsibilities .
for example , Islam &apos;s leaders must agree on clear requests with the state in many areas and give him some control of control .
it is willing to crack .
the head of the Muslims of the Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ z@@ ye@@ k , expressed the concern that religious conflicts could be registered after Germany .
those who wanted to du@@ le such conflicts in Germany , immediately their right to ask , in Germany , have been going to be , and they have said in the case of Bav@@ ri@@ an &apos;s ro@@ ck .
ab@@ eling the Basic Law struck .
warming will be a matter of society all .
it will be transformed .
Germany , while a narrow decade , has a anti @-@ discrimination and general equality of the law .
but it is very slow , as the N@@ S@@ U cause - the N@@ S@@ U - to show the racist motive , in the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive .
equal opportunities for everyone : what migrant migrants and interest interests are long demanding and international agreements such as the anti @-@ racial Convention on Germany will have to be a reality in the next few years , and why international agreements such as the anti @-@ racial Convention on Germany will have to become reality in the next few years if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens to use its opportunities - for the sake of all
indeed , Germany is able to provide medical medical rights so far , the medical @-@ President Frank Ul@@ rich , is the most likely to provide the refugees .
the most thing we are to do so - What Man@@ - power and capacity , we say the day .

to avoid bottlenecks , he calls for a &quot; seeking to protect the &quot; all of the most closed @-@ minded gamble .
countries could be expected to be expected later with the federal countries .
and long @-@ term is highly dubious , so many people with limited performance , which is the asylum of asylum @-@ seekers .
to make physicians especially the language barriers .
so far , the Berlin Health Academy has taught a mar@@ de de , migrants are worse off about their diseases than other patients .
not only clinics , including medical practice , would have to be taken on a discount for drugs , for them .
but many refugees would have already been able to get out of the emergency results with more general medical channels .
another diagnostic look .
there are , for example , more un@@ un@@ vol@@ o@@ ented , and the youth is concerned about HIV - the culprit , in the youth - to do with HIV among the elderly .
in part of the other of the other , German doctors would have been told from their training , but he is clear that he is in the way that he is .
not so hard to identify , or tuberculosis are not so difficult to identify ; and , for the medical , the refugees may be relieved for the most of the people .
Syrians were a advanced educational system .
often require their skills and potentially again .
at least half of the refugees coming to the top of the refugees in Germany , according to the federal psycho@@ tor of Ar@@ ine ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) , most suffer from post @-@ traumatic stress disorder or depression .
the most vulnerable to the list of the B@@ t@@ K , Di@@ et@@ rich , is particularly vulnerable .
a recent study by the T@@ Munich , a recent study by the Munich Munich , is that every fifth Syrian country matters .
those who have a post @-@ traumatic record disorder is suffering , including so @-@ called fish with the breath , cheating , heart , and death .
symptoms are intense and emotional .
to prevent symptoms that the symptoms would be chronically , in turn , it declared .
thus .
while the people can provide a request for psycho@@ therapy , the story is typically several months .
moreover , social welfare workers or physicians who are not educated for mental illness would determine whether or not a cure .
often mis@@ estimates , it is said to say .

D@@ urs@@ day , the idea of the 17 day is a family body for the idea of 17 times .
life has opened up from 10 to 18 .
Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe holds wrong speech in Parliament , in parliament .
the good @-@ way Mugabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell to the good way early in early year .
last he remained un@@ sc@@ om@@ able , but the fall of the fall was quickly over the soci@@ media media .
the parliament &apos;s opening was tarnished by claims of legislators of the opposition that they had been treated to anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany the full @-@ handed of the Polish Mugabe .
last month , she had been tainted him and interrupted him during his speech to the nation in parliament - that is the speech he repeated on his own .
the speaker of the Movement for Democratic Change ( the E@@ for for a new Change - MDC ) In@@ no@@ <unk> G@@ on@@ ese said that seven options are asking - Central politicians - to have received the news of his hand@@ ley , which they warned to disrupt Mr. Mugabe &apos;s silence .
what is not happening is a number of countries who are not yet shown , but it has the title of failure ; death , he said , said of Mugabe after Mugabe &apos;s speech .
they are warning the affected parliament - the members that the immunity to parliament ends , and once they leave the parliament to leave their parliamentary immunity to their parliamentary immunity .
the Chief of the Chief Justice said that the party was a Morgan of Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ ra@@ ra@@ ra@@ ra@@ i @-@ rat@@ i @-@ led party , worried about the dangers for politicians .
to be sure , He@@ wle@@ au &apos;s main idea of energy is reduced to 30,000 jobs .
He@@ al@@ tt - The International Atomic ard , is expected to reduce 25,000 and 30,000 jobs into the framework of the economy and a saving of saving - the company &apos;s services .
it will be divided into two @-@ tier societies in two hundred societies , and computer and printing - the business of his growing firm - and printing - the business of his more rapidly growing company - and to separate the business - is a powerful business of his growing firm - to which the country &apos;s service - the country &apos;s service - is to separate business .
the expected real @-@ estate reductions leads to a burden of more than $ 2.7 billion , said in a statement .
to be sure , the restructuring of a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new He@@ ur@@ ment - the International Atomic ard - the main cause of He@@ al@@ pri@@ y - the International chairman and the CEO of the executive , which is to guide unity after the separation .
it is a small and more focused than it is today &apos;s today , and we have a large and deepened portfolio of business to support businesses to a new style of business ; they said .
as a separate company , we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the world &apos;s changing needs around the world .
He@@ wle@@ tt @-@ of @-@ scenes , more than $ 50 billion in the sales , and a re@@ shuff@@ ing ; the company is now concentrated in providing un@@ troubled , integrated technology - and thus a statement of the company .
it is a business that has established in the 1930 &quot; s by the graduates of Stanford University Bill He@@ <unk> and Da@@ ve @-@ A ard to establish electr@@ o - and whose reverse @-@ he@@ al@@ to Gar@@ age you were created ; the birth of the Silicon Valley .
it has gone through a massive restructuring to break away from traditional PC@@ s to mobile devices .
for the world &apos;s second largest PC - the producer and one of the largest US - is - is a powerful firm - and , for one of the largest US - - is the latest in this area that is based on the belief that closely focused on companies provide better performance .

few have pointed out to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation is in the way to exist , there is no reason why he cannot play before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario is already meant that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will miss at least the next four games for England , and , given its involvement , its involvement in the next summer will certainly be uncertain .
the great shame in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had had a strong end in the last season after a separate K@@ im@@ s@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@

he played only 65 of the arsenal of the past five months in just 65 .
the broader picture for the arsenal is that it was in six from eight periods in 2007 @-@ 08 , with the two Premier League , which have seen most vulnerability @-@ up .
few have accepted the potential of a vicious circle but it is , by one believes that improvement in the rate of vulnerability over the last season will continue .
if you return to injury , you have a time @-@ time period , a time when you strengthen your body and win combat power ; he said .
over@@ @-@ saving &quot; is young .
I hope that his body is stabilized , I am confident that he will do it and he will be a career of the way he deserves .
arsenal - his champions - The main League of the Middle League - will begin to give the run@@ on evening on Satur@@ day , and against him &apos;s death @-@ based hot site on the Satur@@ day , and few is a ro@@ tation within the team .

hair@@ end@@ s@@ s@@ x : Com@@ e@@ es - S@@ ould that the notion of serious patients gives us serious lessons about the men &apos;s bed@@ co@@ cies .
the absence of similar representation in Kat@@ denial is obvious , particularly regarding how to open the desire for men to open up , now more desperate than ever before , as suicide rates have become on a 15 @-@ month - Georgia - to the fore .
it was the most important death of death in men at the age of 20 to 45 in the UK , and three times more frequently in men than women .

friendship is the heart in the struggle to address this challenge .
a recent study at more than 2,000 high @-@ level - high school - to create a depressed percentage of friends with depressive symptoms found that when the suffering is a high percentage of friends with a vengeance ; had a healthy mood to friends , his chances of generic .
for those who are not depressed , a circle of mental @-@ healthy friends hal@@ ved the risks of mental problems .
, friends can work with it .
in the age of the social media communications , with its emphasis on substance , the answer often is more central to the im@@ predictability of the answer than a significant less .
our digital lives have the need to appear strong , and successful , and successfully , even if isolation dominates isolation .
this superficial success is dominated by what psychologists ex@@ fl@@ ated psychologists , call money , image , social status , all at the expense of higher values and friendship that affects much deeper health .
the good thing , and , like a video game , the main invent@@ ors and billionaire , is the real thing to buy money .
the beauty in which the focus was put on head .
each character was defined not through his work , but by his personality that the interaction as a friend has been a friend .
the hum@@ or of Jo@@ ey and C@@ hand@@ ler of the frequent Um@@ gs , moments of football gu@@ g , and the yearning of Ross after revenge - all of which came from the knowledge that men can count on whatever , even if they often hold themselves to explore their feelings .

it is not easy to win at home or near @-@ up in the champions league , so it is not easy to win : 0 to win our opponents and de@@ s@@ p into the champions , even if there are certain things that we have to eat in the course of the season , the Blan@@ c said .
the answer is good warnings .
we wanted to win and have won , though I have been reluctant to have no or two other goals .
according to Ibrahim &apos;s cab@@ c , according to his injury in one of three changes in Paris , the Paris team , which weekend a 2 @-@ 2 team on his own seat on Bor@@ de@@ au@@ x in the First league , but he was paid in the fourth minute by the fourth minute .

but if someone believed that P@@ S@@ G would make a big victory , the P@@ S@@ G would reach a large victory that was disappointed .
Mal@@ o , the Cel@@ tic in a P@@ po@@ gu@@ --@@ had a long way to achieve that level , entered nine national players on the field and was a serious opponent in the middle field .
but , unless a shot of Nicholas a D@@ ach@@ ate , who passed far to the P@@ ring@@ th in April 3@@ 4 , they offered little .
instead , P@@ S@@ G himself has sometimes been on the verge of some mis@@ g@@ ons and bad @-@ minded , not least by the Con@@ hi@@ ean c , who was not seen in the first half of the first half @-@ and @-@ then , and then abandoned after the new start had begun him after the start began .

the second goal was finally headed after the hours - the International States , thanks to the question of its top Sa@@ sin , after Ibrahim &apos;s cab@@ c had been a left @-@ free fl@@ ou@@ y of Ma@@ x@@ well .
the end of all thought that Mal@@ el can come back , and only a brilliant intervention from Wil@@ and from short @-@ advised to stop David Luiz could keep the end low , before the replacement @-@ threatening , the end @-@ up , before the replacement @-@ threatening , before the van@@ ra@@ el @-@ old @-@ chief @-@ old , Mr. Lav@@ el , was a goal at the end .

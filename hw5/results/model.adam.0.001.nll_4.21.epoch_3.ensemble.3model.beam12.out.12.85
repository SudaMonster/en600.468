8 poll show that Donald ales is serious .
some have tried to get him as a fl@@ op .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
some wait for a collapse .
nevertheless , no matter how some Republicans are trying to draw on the top . &quot; has not worked .
in the chances of the last 11 @-@ real national nomination , Donald Moore &apos;s , means , and some begin to think seriously about the chances of real estate &apos;s nomination .
it is , of course , early in the electoral term .
no one claims that , most likely , the Republican nomination will likely win .
experts stress that , in 2011 , Rick P@@ ain &apos;s leadership was found in the process of 2011 &apos;s Nobel C@@ ain , which no one state in the process of the process won .
and there are many reasons why he would have in a general election .
now , outsiders , such as Jean @-@ Bush &apos;s super @-@ Bush &apos;s super @-@ Sup@@ er , PA@@ C and the conservative economic group Club for Growth and begin to leave their dollars to topple it .
here is not only a temporary phase : the modus gu@@ l is not only a temporary period :
increases &apos;s popularity ratings have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before only two of ten Republicans announced the real estate - Mo@@ gu@@ l positive that only two of ten Republicans saw real estate - Mo@@ gu@@ gu@@ l positively saw real estate .
by mid @-@ July , it was 40 % .
August was 52 % .
now six of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald degrees .
for example , three of 10 say that they have a negative opinion .
these numbers are holding in early states .
1 % of Republicans have a good say that 60 % of Republicans have a good say .
two @-@ thirds of the G@@ O@@ P - E@@ O@@ P , G@@ O@@ P , would be happy to be a candidate .
in a survey of CNN / F@@ C last week , 67 % of Republicans said that they would be either fixed ; or &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp;
only two of 10 say , they would be angry ; if he were the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son creates roughly the same enthusiasm as there is , 43 % say , the same enthusiasm of 40 % who say the same thing in the same way ) .
the next thing in enthusiasm ?
Mar@@ co calls with only 21 % .
on the other side , 47 % of Republican voters say that they would be unhappy ; if not , Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a Republican majority does not look as a problem .
while Donald widespread evidence is widely criticized for his bom@@ bas@@ tic and offensive statements , 52 % of Italy &apos;s voters , who believe that the real estate is the right temper@@ ament for a president , so A@@ BC News / Washington Post on Mon@@ day .
the same number of the nation &apos;s first week , the state of state , where the same 52 % of Republicans think that he has a stake , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ k ac last week .
of this , 44 % say that his temper@@ ament does not go into the White House , so that his temper@@ ament does not go into the White House , so A@@ BC / Post .
Republican voters get used to the idea .
when they are putting their subjects , Republican voters hold that they are real in real terms .
if they are asked who is the most likely bet on the G@@ O@@ P .
this is a change since the time four from 10 end of 10 ended its money on Y@@ b Bush .
full disclosure : G@@ O@@ P is not the most obvious crystal ball in the past .
at this point in the last cycle , four of ten Republicans thought that the nomination would win the nomination only 28 % for the final candidate Mitt Romney .
yet shows that a number of G@@ O@@ P has shown that a number of G@@ O@@ P is an understandable view .
even if the Republicans collec@@ ts around another candidate , there is almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to the leadership , while the anti @-@ Americanism - the threat to which the anti @-@ Americanism - the threat of the Americas - is being distributed to more than a dozen other candidates .
but in early September , at the beginning of September , at the beginning of September , at the beginning of September , at the beginning of September , at the beginning of September , at the beginning of September , it shows that in a hypothetical head - the presidential race - and most other Republican candidates , a majority of liberal support .
it has been on the brink of 13 points before Mar@@ b Bush , and , finally , on the brink of Paul , John cents , and Chris <unk> e @-@ 33 items .
it is an head of responsibility - the head of power - for the sake of t@@ ed C@@ ru@@ z .
the only candidate that suggests him ?
Ben Car@@ son would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head - a vice race .
a near @-@ time majority of Donald challenges - &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; #
a new poll by CB@@ S / N@@ Y@@ T on service shows that only more than half of the voters who support them say that they have more than half of the electorate who support their votes .
of course , much can be done to change this , and nobody can never say that it never to change .
46 % said that they can make the door open to change other candidates .
nevertheless , the most powerful competition at the moment of the other maver@@ ick , the neur@@ och@@ o Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say that they have formed their opinion are twice as frequent .
six of 10 Republicans say that they are related to immigration .
since in his campaign , &quot; the immigration was turned out of the public discourse .

but , according to the new A@@ BC / Post &apos;s new A@@ BC / Post , six from 10 Republicans say that they agree with the issue of immigration .
so long as immigration is in the spotlight on the spotlight in the spotlight , it will seem to do so much to do so .
frustration with the government is soaring at the highest levels .
now roughly half of the support of Republican voters , especially through their maver@@ ick , has been growing .
six of 10 Republicans want to be a political outsider as someone with government experience .
they are also angry to Washington .

Europe &apos;s sovereign @-@ crisis crisis : Hungary , the border , extends to the border , keeps refugees back to refugees , and keeps refugees back to refugees .
Hungary explains the influx of migrants , and held the southern border with Serbia .
chaos responded in the border , when hundreds of migrants responded in a kidney country , and Serbian officials with indignation responded .
people who fled violence have been found for an unknown period in the streets between the two control of the country and built up there .
but frustrations rose . &quot;
when a police helicopter against them , the migrants were opening !
some had returned to protest and water .
Serbia &apos;s foreign minister declared that migrants were sent back from Hungary , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece .
( Serbia ) wants part of the solution , not collateral damage .
in the coming days of talks with Brussels and other countries , it said I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague .
a day after 28 - the nations of a day after 28 - The nations of a day in Brussels was not consistent with a disputed meeting in Brussels .
but the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people , who sought to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in Italy and Greece .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special summit in the European Union to discuss the continent &apos;s immigration crisis .
Hungary , however , did not set his hopes for an early action of Brussels or from its neighbors .
the need to deal in two southern regions had more powers to cope with the crisis in two southern regions , so that they could accelerate the streets and accelerate asylum @-@ seekers .
meanwhile , the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ ak@@ to , meanwhile , said that his country also had the construction of a pile of a pile along its border with Romania to stop the influx of migrants from the country - after joining a fence on the Serbian border .

in the Middle East , Hungary and elsewhere in the Middle East has become a significant English , and the European Union has become a significant point in the European Union .
but Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted that most of the economic agents who are in search for a better life , and not prisoners of war , claim for protection - a view that is strongly at odds with other EU - the states , including Germany .
the new laws that joined a force in Hungary , the new laws , and the damage of the 4 @-@ 4 ated ( 13 meters ) , will make us a crime ( 13 ) that the government could build on a crime with the southern border to Serbia , a crime , as well as higher prison sentences for convicted human traffickers .
as a result of the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the state state of state , and , in the southern city of S@@ ol@@ tan Ko@@ l &apos;s reporters in the southern city .
we say it very clear : the illegal border over a crime is a crime .
parliament must be able to be seen on the use of the military , which will be expected for next week , but reporters in the border have heavily seen armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days .
indeed , the country &apos;s leading @-@ 15 Bak@@ on@@ di , said that the country has already entered 45 &apos;s people in trying to cross the border . 15 others were already deeper in the country .
we are accused of the fence , they are now accused of police in police custody and are accused of the new laws .
authorities are quick to fix the fence .
Hungarian officials joined two of the seven border signatories with Serbia after a train train to close borders to the borders .
chaos close to the data of the people in a metal of all the world &apos;s major border , including Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal of all - he opened up the data of people and asked a crowd in order to get back on it .
about 20 , thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main act of Hungary - a combination of Serbia blocked Hungary and Hungary , saying that they would deny food and water until they can go to Hungary .

but Clinton still has a big margin among older voters .
last month , Clinton was head @-@ à @-@ vis @-@ à @-@ vis liberals in the last month .
if they were nominated by the party , about half of the EU &apos;s democratic voters .
a quarter would support them with some of them , and another 15 % would support them only because it is the candidate .
they would not support six % .
perhaps not surprisingly , Clinton &apos;s current supporters are primarily enthusiastic .
the views are stronger in those who currently support Clinton - only about a quarter , a quarter would support them .
while 35 % say &quot; with enthusiasm , say , 48 % of the Democratic electorate say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , say less Republican voters about their top presidential candidates ( 35 % ) .
if Clinton is asked in an open question ( 16 % ) , the most common answer is that a woman is president ( 13 % ) , followed that a woman is president ( 13 % ) , and that it is the best candidate for the job ( 10 % ) .
by Clinton &apos;s supporters , their association with Bill Clinton ( 9 % ) is mentioned .
agreement for dealing with problems and di@@ titude will also be cited .
with Vice President a potential for the presidency , 57 % of democratic voters want to see him in the race - though one @-@ third believes that he should not do it .
if democratic voters will be asked for the party , who would be their second choice , Biden at the top .
of Clinton &apos;s supporters , more than half , that Biden would be far from S@@ different .
certainly is in the race for 30 points , with Biden in the race for 30 points , with Biden in the race for 30 points .
twenty @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chance to win , but has fallen from 78 % last month .
Biden is a second in this measuring , but the percentage that has been on him as a &quot; elec@@ ous one . &quot;
yet , at the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about voting .
similarly , no single democracy candidate or potential candidate for these voters is proving unacceptable .
the Democratic candidates , or potential candidates , provide good results in some important features of their party &apos;s primary Party .
they see Clinton , S@@ different , and Biden as honest and trust and with strong leadership .
Biden is best at honesty for the three candidates , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the leadership .
( 15 % ) , Clinton &apos;s voters believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy , but 27 % have no opinion of him .
democratic voters in general see Clinton , S@@ different , and Biden , in con@@ formity with their views .
for all of these measures , about one @-@ quarter of democratic voters .
because questions about Hillary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal em@@ E call for a personal e - call to ask - and to continue to be tried as Secretary of State during the term as Secretary of State , most Democratic voters are satisfied with their explanation , and say that it has not affected their views on the whole .
but it is a different story in America &apos;s public as a whole .
half of Americans are unhappy with their explanation , while only one @-@ third is satisfied .
public opinion was divided in March , just after the problem came to light .
36 % said that their opinion has deteriorated from her or worse .
Republicans are worse , more than six from 10 , who say that their views of Clinton have become worse .
although Clinton is perceived to be honest and trustworthy by the voters of their party as honest and trustworthy , this remains a problem for them among voters as a whole : only 32 % see it as honest and trustworthy , eight % less than last month and 15 points less since May .
in 62 % of the electorate they do not think for a honest and trustworthy person .
at the same time , 55 % of the electorate &apos;s voters have not been honest and un@@ trustworthy .
but Clinton and the Caribbean , however , receive good No@@ ds in leadership . &quot;
of the six @-@ ended candidates , Biden , Car@@ son , and Bush are best in honesty .
a majority is more likely to be honest , but , like Car@@ son , many do not think of him .
the error rate for the validity of 3@@ 51 Democratic Democratic voters is 6 percentage points .

Republican voters continue to support a 27 % in the large number poll in the last month .
but Car@@ son shot the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
the poll also revealed that Car@@ son is well superior to demographic groups , with higher education among Republican voters with higher education .

that will happen when the Fed increases interest rates to raise interest rates .
interest rates will rise , and the economy will fal@@ ter into recession , and the economy will rise into recession .
we know that .
we do not know how long it will last , and how long it will last .
in particular , history is limited to the economy .
a recession came from just 11 months after the first rate of interest @-@ rate hikes and lasted 86 months .
the Federal Reserve &apos;s aggressi@@ veness is often , if not always , one factor how the economy and financial assets respond .
as a result , US Federal Reserve officials have stressed that investors should not focus on raising interest rates , but rather on the period that norm@@ alizes .
indeed , several variables play a role .
in the end , however , market participants may find that the whole excitement of interest rate may be exaggerated .
in fact , the Fed &apos;s first increase since the global financial crisis is bound to be a signal to the end of the era of the era ; cheap money is being interpreted ; read , read J@@ ess@@ op , the chief economist in Capital Economics , in a community of customers .
by contrast , we do not expect a gradual return to the US - high interest rates , but still at low levels to fear that many seem to be feared .
but this does not mean that there will be no effect .
here is a historical record of historical trends on how some areas of the economy could respond :
as the market has seen in the past month , expect interest rate hikes can be volatile for a while .
once raising increases , the influence is not so dramatic .
to be sure , there seems to be a tendency that asset @-@ rate analysts will have 12 @-@ 24 months after the first increase , which may well reflect delay in monetary policy .
market published in the last 35 cycles , with a average return in the last 35 days , according to an average return in the last 35 @-@ year cycles of 1@@ 4.4 % , according to a current analysis in the last 35 days , with a average return in the last 35 @-@ year cycles in the last 35 days , with a average return in the last 35 @-@ year cycles in the last 35 days
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on stocks tends to occur in the wake of the cycle , and the rate of return is beginning to decline .
recessions are a fact of economic life .
in the current case , the Fed faces some conditions that could not have occurred , and that could accelerate a recession .
what is highly remarkable is that GDP will be near its lowest interest rate hike .
according to the Deutsche Bank , the 1@@ 18 interest rate since 1950 was below 4.5 % .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 % , few expect that this will last , and expect only 1.5 % for the third quarter .
so fragile economic Bank could be risky and raise the question , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank .
in the Fed &apos;s interest rate , and all eyes were at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in this week .
as many strategists and economists believe that the FO@@ M@@ C could approve an increase in that meeting , the futures of trade is only a 25 % probability .
as the study , in our study , the report cycles . in our study , all wave cycles cycles from 1950 to the day @-@ in @-@ a @-@ half world .
by contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery of what caused the worst recession .
the current cycle is far the longest that the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months .
the firm income , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the impact on bonds is faster than stocks when their strategic course change course .
as a result , the returns to change once the first increase in the cycle comes in the cycle .
at the end of the broken cycle , bond yields fall down , the Deutsche Bank said .
increases in the interest rate lead to an increase in interest rates between longer and shorter bonds .
high @-@ rate bonds often yield better returns in such a climate , though we are still careful to expect higher returns .
interesting , then , that markets have already adjusted to the Fed - the strategy of fiscal policy .
it adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy , it wrote that the market has adjusted to tighter monetary policy .
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , and volatility has risen , and volatility has risen - all of the market , if the Fed aggrav@@ ates its strategy .
in large and local goods , companies who use the larger share of their business activities in the US will benefit if interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies make their products more costly to the global market , as well as the financing of its debt .
moreover , &quot; Goldman Sachs &quot; predicted , Goldman Sachs , Goldman Sachs - &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp
firms with strong balance sheet have exceeded 5 percentage points after each of the rate hikes in 1994 , 1999 , and 2004 .
percentage @-@ capital firms , and lower volatility in their shares , also out@@ hit their counterparts with low quality of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will be a big problem .
companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose most .
outside the cash games , consumers are also benefiting by the rising dollar .
experts could see profits from higher returns , even though experts are different .

it is a historic event , because the Fed has put interest rates on zero .

Adam Libya was clearly threatened , but it is still difficult for the exclusion of England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult to see it .
confronting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you have chosen the cadres that the England has chosen for the Tour is a repeat of the 3 t - Georgia &apos;s defeat was not on my map .
I would not rule out an exit .
A@@ load , however , may have gotten less positive than the three years ago , but there is a positive attitude in the batteries - and the common spirit is strong ; they will not carry out in 2012 - and the common spirit is strong ; they will not carry a youthful position in 2012 .
he is an unknown size to the test , one option is an option for attack .
the related news is that Adam x H@@ ales is replaced by the England - the test challenge - Adam cadres , and is replaced by Ale@@ x .
, of course , the decision to analyze Adam Libya &apos;s th , of course , is hard to analyze me .
in his seven tests , there were two good assaults under difficult conditions , and the easy but harsh reality is that krill players are designed to results .
there were no question at Joe Ro@@ ot , for example , and I have said that , for example , their own best choices are .
it would have been extended long ago , but he had the control of his own fate .
if he hopes , another chance will be another chance .
the England , for example , openly praised his stance , even if he did not perform so good , and not surprised me ; he is a man who is , above all , a team .
the question , as much time a test , is challenging .
ly@@ th , seven opportunities - like Sam ro@@ son before him - was given to seven opportunities , while N@@ ick &apos;s ton was nine .
only a decade got the chance to be held and exit .
the only charge is now in the past .

it is a X of a X - a factor that is a source of responsibility - a Canadian chess player , as he saw 2@@ 36 in this season when he took 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ y Bri@@ dge , making us very close to us .
he needs to be at least the same chance , of course , but this will depend on the basis of the team in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea of an example would be able to strike mode along with Germany , which would give an example of an exodus - turning out - p@@ w@@ ler and four Qu@@ ic@@ ks , &quot; and I would do nothing about it , and I did nothing about it .

but the plant Jer@@ e Cor@@ B@@ n , which I gave me to me on Mon@@ day &apos;s Mon@@ day , he told him that he had no time to waste me to waste for me - and he told him that he had no time for me to waste - seems to be repeated in danger of repeating N@@ .@@ New no@@ ed@@ ov &apos;s boycott of 80 power - a mistake then and now .

the evidence ; the evidence of the last month and describes him as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
but some researchers have challenged the resilience of the data and have pointed out to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
in the medical journal last month , and the most important conclusion on which the US@@ E has established its most important conclusion .
two other researchers write into B@@ M@@ Y , and have asked whether the claims goes back ; on a stone or sand .
Martin Mc@@ Ke@@ e , a professor for European public @-@ health care in the London School of Hy@@ giene and Tro@@ p@@ ony , and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , professor for L@@ ony epidemi@@ ology at the University of Li@@ ver@@ pool , said : a fundamental principle of public health is that policies should be based on the evidence of the effectiveness .
they said that the public is expected to believe that the current @-@ best estimate is that the current best estimate is that , say , 95 % are less damaging than smoking , on a detailed review of the difference and Mo@@ del@@ ration .
indeed , this statement comes from a single session of 12 .
Mc@@ Ke@@ e and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsors of the meeting was a firm called Euro@@ Health Health , whose chief director should have received an independent study .
he also signed the credentials of asked for public health in a sustainability report , said they .
one of the 12 participants agreed to preserve funds from an e @-@ bailout - aid to cigarettes - to preserve cigarettes , but not to finance funding , which he is supposed to be awarded by the tobacco companies Philip ed International &apos;s tobacco companies .
the reasons for the members of the panel &apos;s members will not be met , but this includes a number of well @-@ known e @-@ making to the paper .
some other participants at the meeting are not well known for their know of their know @-@ à @-@ vis tobacco control .
at the meeting , tobacco .
the group &apos;s research work is telling . that there is a shortage of harsh evidence to the damage of most products on most criteria ; there are , Mc@@ Ke@@ e and Cap@@ e@@ well .
but none of these links or restrictions on the US@@ E will be discussed .
Mc@@ Ke@@ e and Cap@@ e@@ well said that it is no evidence that there has been no evidence that around the e , there has been no evidence that around the end of the e .
Pro@@ f , director for health and well @-@ being , said that the claims of B@@ M@@ Y had already been addressed before .
he said : &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ;
up to each addiction .
all evidence suggests that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects .
there is a clear duty to public information about what is proof of tobacco , and what is not , especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers of tobacco .
nearly 80,000 people die each year on the smoking , and smoking costs two billion dollars per year .
as a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we meet our national jurisdiction .
the BBC should abandon E@@ ast@@ En@@ ders , says a former head of Cheney &apos;s 4 @-@ 4 @-@ 4 @-@ 4 4
former head of Ch@@ Z@@ el &apos;s 4 , Lu@@ ke Johnson , has said that the BBC should stop using programs like E@@ ast@@ ac@@ m and The Vo@@ ice ; he said that commercial rivals would be able to do so ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45
Johnson said that the type of programs should be used only to make the kind of programs that cannot be diverted by other UK .
he criticized the BBC &apos;s most publicly - offering legal programs , which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience .
in partnership with the BBC - Director General , Tony H@@ all , said that companies wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he had tried for six years to come with the BBC for six years .
to be sure , I have done problems with the idea that the BBC spends on behalf , or sends to the upper house of the BBC , the House of the House of the House of the House of the House , the House of the House of the House of the House .
, if you want to keep the radio , at least on programs that do not .
they send The Vo@@ ice at a first @-@ rate window of time because they want to achieve the lowest broad support for their future .
the idea that no one else would show this is a joke , it is ridiculous , of course nonsense .
Johnson said : I don &apos;t see why a re@@ gressive tax is financed programs that could be financed without subsidies .
the bird ice is such a program , E@@ ast@@ grandchildren , is another , admittedly both self @-@ productivity .
frankly , other channels would give up their rights .
I am asked to see how this is publicly challenged .
I do not believe that this would actually reduce the BBC .
Johnson , a business businessman who led the Ch@@ ann@@ el 4 of 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC was blamed for ratings , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support .
his comments to sell the BBC &apos;s most popular show . the former head of sk@@ y , the former head of sk@@ y , the former head of sk@@ y , the former head of sk@@ y , the former head of sk@@ y , the former head of sk@@ y , the former head of sk@@ y .
Johnson said that , of course , the more public @-@ minded programs - the no public has to be found . ) , of course , should go to B@@ BC@@ 4 , and they can argue that if they are not measured by the audience , they have been prepared to do so , of course , and they can be able to do so , of course , that no one has seen .
they put them into a window of time in which nobody wanted to see it .
in terms of conditions can get the best value : I urge to find a more re@@ gressive system in terms of conditions that can get the best value to it .
of course , you all think that we all think we all think about 150 per year , but for people who are a lot of money for the $ 150 billion , I wonder whether they do not consume much from the BBC .
the former Sk@@ es and maintain 5 % - the leader of David El@@ stein , who was also told the committee before the committee on service , called for the BBC to review its rice to be able to form and maintain its rice .
radio , he said , said that only the BBC would be able to be classified by the BBC - which he said that it would be 1 % of their TV - and that it should be changed in the public - and maintain an example of this change in the public and Canada - as well as 0.1 % in Australia and Canada .
to the question of the partnerships , the BBC told El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas such as the pro@@ mit@@ ation that he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and to take alliances available to commercial channels to make everything online online .

the video shows how the persistence will change the direction of the moment in which they are punished with K@@ lan@@ ons .
scientists have been created with genetically modified nervous systems .

the researchers said that the story showed the power of a new trial , called P@@ o@@ an &apos;s power to activ@@ ate a series of brain - heart , heart , and muscle - to activ@@ ate cells outside the body .
one day , S@@ re@@ e@@ th C@@ hal@@ as@@ ani , researchers at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , said that the process might one day replace the depths of the steam - the whole way to replace the electrical impulses of people to treat the symptoms of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
in the typically do not respond to ultra @-@ all , but C@@ hal@@ as@@ ani found it when they were surrounded by a liquid @-@ air air bubbles .
bubbles , he found out , increase the ultra @-@ chur@@ waves , which then enter into the worms .
the spread of Ul@@ oc@@ waves are on structures , the TR@@ P Strategy - the International IC@@ I@@ V station , and to be found in the lines of some of the worms .
the pattern of these I@@ combatants and activ@@ ate the cells that they are ordered is a report of Nature .
so C@@ hal@@ as@@ ani genetically changed , C@@ hal@@ as@@ ani genetically changed the worms that some of their prot@@ on@@ ons are TR@@ P - the responsibility of I@@ 4 .
when he uses ultra @-@ eu@@ als to changed cre@@ ats , the spread caused by micro@@ b@@ bs are reinforced , and , in the worms , where they are changing by the altered engines of their pur@@ ons .
the process has made some similarities to the list of options , a ground@@ breaking To@@ ol , which allows scientists to get neurons with stimulus on the lights .
but C@@ hal@@ as@@ ani said that it could have some advantage of this technology .

eight @-@ golden rules for life in students
even more than 11 years ago , I looked as a self @-@ forgotten , still in the belief of Berezovsky and moral relativi@@ sm , but only now I remember . I remember that I have taken - and the numerous , long @-@ suffering complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be dismissed in eight simple rules .
the entry in the number of students is easy to become absolutely terrifying .
it is tempting : people tell where you com@@ com@@ st , whether , whether you are going on , whether you are going on , whether you stand up on cor@@ B@@ n , and why you are asked , because you do not love your love , because you do not love your love , because you have neither love and hate , because you do not love your love , because you have neither love and
breathe you .
and help others to do the same - do you ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ ts the conversation , and helps you to learn the people who don &apos;t speak , even if your che@@ ers were set fire , and that fire of fire would be .
result people . &quot;
ab@@ always turn to people who are often turning into line , but they are also the places where people want to attract and get their subordin@@ es to the right .
in the same way , you do not think about the relationship with a relationship with start start to start with a relationship with start start to start with a relationship with start start to start with a relationship with start start .
gross treatment receive a university treatment .
and it should always be a re@@ b@@ um , but many student skills constitute a space - the drive for development - the cause of power , which is friendly and socially , and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who is trying to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say : I may go you , and I want to leave our friendship , I want to leave the energy that I have spent on the interaction for the interaction .
try to feel when a fellow militant one can be exhausted - and send him a case at work .
thing you do .
a cand@@ l had a cand@@ l in my student return , the idea that a not @-@ designed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
@-@ beating friendship . &quot;
because you are beginning at the height of the recovery .
a good way to close friend@@ ships .
their fellow citizens feel committed to stay , and will at the end of your face at the end of a le@@ ck@@ al surprise .
, of course , this depends on whether you are a decent leg .
thing you are ill @-@ conceived , sugar , and fat cause people to sleep up if you pay .
to steal food is a common crime in the student of students .
of course , it is a theft , of course , but it is the N@@ dd@@ er of a dr@@ w of chicken to your tea ?
check with the Arctic .
the odds are good that they say themselves to service themselves .
if someone added your milk , you try to punish it , but try to try to deal with more than my fellow milk .
it is now in prison .
they should be unable to make the people from sleep or from the work .
it sit not only to be a decent man , but that you belong to the people who are in the glass house .
a girl on the morning had a test .
responded music .
after all , when she heard around 5 @-@ clock , she kept their neighbors to sleep two hours before she left their own music to their own music , killing their door , and begin for their final @-@ time test .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future adul@@ partners happens to enter the same student of the home .
conversely , it would not be a deep thing for your future marriage to return to them for your future marriage , who will have to divide them , and , perhaps and perhaps , how to get all common friends ?
of course , the heart of the heart of the heart is its own paths - but if you are definitely not your future marriage , you try at least trying to tell your under@@ bel@@ b a little reason .
thing seems to be found between an ultra @-@ W and M@@ ob@@ ll .

thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
to know how fast @-@ cost housing can be created : it is building in a project for refugees .
Mr. Gil@@ d@@ ner , many refugees will push for the housing market .
what is the solution ?
thing Gil@@ d@@ ner has no sustainability .
for people remain too big .
in the coming decades , we also need sufficient housing in the coming decades .
a nasty , three @-@ dimensional travel of travel , is the solution .
Gil@@ d@@ ner : a travel drain for the least .
it makes it easier for integration .
this is a different way to do the people .
each of the six houses that are built in the pilot project there are three residential units for each four asylum seekers .
each unit has two bed@@ room , bad , cu@@ che , and an area room .
it may be that many people will say that it is peace , I get back .
then the homes can easily be built into their needs .
how large are the costs ?
Gil@@ d@@ ner : the price of € 160 meters per house is at 18@@ 4 , without land .
is manageable .
six months of construction took place .
that is appropriate .
are the construction rules complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ d@@ ner : construction , I have learned my project .
in particular , it is always complicated that the threat of Dam@@ o@@ o@@ es@@ es@@ es@@ es@@ es@@ va is very complicated , and the rule of a settlement order .
green .
there will be at least three , more , who creates a travel of three homes .
only in the cities are missing .
refugees and asylum seekers have not cars .
how did the An@@ ans have responded to their travelers to travel ?
Gil@@ d@@ ner : there were those who have been accused of creating a luxury built @-@ up of asylum seekers .
what is definitely wrong .
but does not exacerbate the competition for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ d@@ ner : true , we had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but built on luxury homes , which can hardly afford to afford .
my project need the message , including ordinary people .
not only refugees , not just refugees , but also the single mother or the lower income .
I tell how to build today and well .

as a result , the border of border , too , will extend to our southern border .
the controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
still , it is clear that anyone who wants to give an asylum request , which can be taken on , of course .

but it is clear that there are strong signals , and he said of ministers .

the idea of the border - particularly unacceptable Hungary - will intensify the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors .
the border with Croatia , however , has already controlled greatly .
as the ministerial minister pointed out , he wants to abandon his borders to refugees .
as a result , the system of the EU cannot be able to fill its commitments , otherwise , the system cannot function ; it emphasized the system of t@@ ni@@ s .
as the Cro@@ an government told , the first refugees had already tried to go out of the direction .
the People &apos;s police could take them in the near @-@ fields fields .
according to local media , there have been a new refugees with new refugees .
it is concentrated in the face of Syrians and Afghans , including many women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in the use .
in the coming days of view , the interior minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic said .

but the government in Belgrade , however , denied that it is meant to beat certain routes : neither can we , nor do we want to do so .
according to media reports , at least in the early place , there would be a first leg of roughly 50 refugees in the Serbian border city Si@@ d .

the detainees were the whole night from the approximately 500 kilometers away from Serbia .
to be sure , we have heard that one of Hungary has made it , so the police said that we should go on here , said of the refugees .
they wanted to travel to Germany by Croatia , Slovenia , and Austria .
indeed , it is now that observers , already predicted to observers already predicted , will have a somewhat more Western @-@ looking Hungary .

stresses for the event of a strong influx of refugees - have prepared plans for possible conditions .
details , he did not , he pointed out , but he pointed out that Croatia was a non @-@ existent .
consider strict controls to qualify for membership .
Slovenia is part of this since 2007 , the EU has given a good testimony to the country since 2007 , which concerns the standard of border controls .
on a Serb side , behind the Hungarian border , remain around 300 refugees .
according to media reports , they would have spent the past night .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border overlap of dreams and Bo &apos;s i remain utterly closed .
whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Cro@@ l border is not yet clear .
the Serbian Interior Minister , Ne@@ bo@@ j@@ sa St@@ ty@@ vi@@ c sought to calm down at a local eye shine in horror , with the debate about alternative routes from refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed , for premature .
it would not be very high refugee numbers .
whether they would continue to continue their journey about Hungary , Croatia , or a different country .
migrant workers to migrants - dangerous - alternative routes .
but private Hungarian workers have already begun to distribute the refugees of land cards on which alternative routes of Croatia .
the border between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border , there are 20 years after the end of Croatia &apos;s war .

is in danger of the United States .
the map is a reminder of the fact that the Fed is supposed to dominate - the European leader of Jan@@ et L@@ et L@@ ern@@ es - and their colleagues should set the nation &apos;s economic interests before all else .
the central bank has a double mandate of Congress : maximizing US employment and prices stable .
but , since the Great Recession , the Fed has recognized leaders that there are an unwritten third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X of the X - a factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict the unprecedented incentive from the near @-@ zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
, while most data in the economy shows that it is growing , the recent turmoil of global financial markets could make the already prudent Fed - and is just one @-@ quarter point .
to be sure , the labor market and inflation will primarily be the most important thing they observe .
thing , she said , if they were looking for a pretext not to raise the interest rate , is the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market .
, there is no consensus about what the Fed will do about the financial market .
for example , half of the economists who recently been asked by Bloomberg have predicted this week .
financial markets , however , expect an escape to the Fed , with a key indicator that demonstrates only one 30 % chance of an increase .
this suggests a decline in the stock market , if the Fed raised the blow by promising that another increase is far removed .
on the Dow , the Dow dropped 2@@ 2@@ 8.@@ 89 points , or by 1.4 % to 16@@ .@@ 5@@ 9@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the Fed has been triggered by expectations that the Fed has been asking for the Fed &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160
it would be a surprise if the Fed would raise rates at this point , he said .
if it does , it would have to go very far in order to calm financial markets , lest it into panic .
other experts argued that the rate hike would calm the financial markets , because it will eliminate uncertainty about when the Fed will act .
a month would test the Fed &apos;s strength in the US . the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of the recovery in the US .
, in the spring and early summer that , despite the complaints of liberals , they would be required in this year , despite the complaints of liberals that more economic progress would be needed to raise a rise in the price .
although job creation slowed in August , the improvement in the labor market was solid this year .
unemployment fell to 5.@@ 1 % last month , the lowest since more than seven years and near the Lev@@ ration that the Fed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and , while inflation remained below the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the Fed said that the main reason was far lower oil prices .
, the chief economist at the pan@@ the@@ on , the chief economist at the pan@@ the@@ on , the chief economist at the pan@@ the@@ on , said of the labor market .
but financial markets devalued over the world last month after China devalued its currency .
the Chinese economy slows by more than 16 % in May , when investors feared that a slowdown in China &apos;s economy would slow global growth .
the market has recovered this month , with the Dow now growing by almost 10 % below the barrel of May .
for the Fed , market turbulence influence the complex calculations of when to raise interest rates .
in the past few weeks , if events in financial markets and the news about the weakness of China &apos;s economy were not appeared in the last few weeks , it would not have occurred in this meeting , and , in the last few weeks , it would have failed to do so in this meeting , and , in the past few weeks , according to the L@@ L@@ A Z@@ im@@ an Center for real E@@
now he says that they will wait at least a month to tackle the impact .
there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US will be - the economy , and there is almost no reliable data to describe developments in China .
none of the Fed &apos;s health is the Fed , so it should not be involved in its decision @-@ making .
but , in the end , the Fed &apos;s monetary authority has become the world &apos;s monetary authority .
the central bank &apos;s influence over the last few years has been enormous .
the mere evidence of then @-@ in @-@ then Ben Bernanke &apos;s then suggestion in 2013 that the Fed could be able to expand its monetary expansion ; it could cause contagion around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined , the Fed can be expected to monitor not only developments elsewhere , but also with other central banks and experts to maintain a better understanding of the global economy .

refugees are asking : the study warns a housing gap .
the situation on the German housing market is tense .
refugees , too , are looking for more refugees to be affordable .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing challenge is facing a challenge .
distributional battles on the German housing market have long begun .
in many big cities are increasingly pushing for a market where many big cities are already over@@ run in many large cities .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens for the past paid .
would need to be built for affordable homes by 2020 , every year would be built into 400,000 new units by 2020 .
as a result , a study &apos;s mandate comes to the Treaty &apos;s mandate . &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp;
compared to comparison , this year , Germany is running 2@@ 60,000 units .
there are no 14@@ 0,000 .
refugees , after the first three months of their homes , are no longer committed to live in a first @-@ time asylum system .
many are entering the housing market and , in the long run , long before the r@@ et@@ ums .
according to statistical federal office , however , the last year is less than half of total asylum seekers .
but the negative development of the housing market is not just the rising refugee numbers .
the study also makes significant failures in the housing market policy of recent years .
Germany is entering a housing deficit that will widen by year .
currently , there are already roughly 7@@ 7@@ 0,000 neighborhoods units in the range of 7@@ 7@@ 0,000 neighborhoods of roughly 7@@ 7@@ 0,000 residential units , the study of Mat@@ ons , author of the study .
many professional workers are so vulnerable to large @-@ scale cities in W@@ DC .
because of the slack in the housing market , young adults were in charge of the housing market .
in large cities , the number of square per capita per capita has declined in the past few years .
to solve the problem , the Alliance is creating a fresh start .
new incentives are designed to stimulate social construction .
as a result , and the basic tax on mortgage @-@ made housing could be exposed .
moreover , according to the Alliance , an alliance is needed for the Alliance .
in cities and communities , the funding program of the state of K@@ f@@ W comes well in cities and communities .
a good week after the start was more than half of the total roughly $ 300 million , with 18@@ 4 million in 18@@ 4 million .

refugees have free content : Croatia and Slovenia on cor@@ ri@@ dor , Croatia and Slovenia , have a cor@@ ri@@ dor of cor@@ ri@@ dor .
after Hungary , virtually no longer come for more refugees .
Z@@ agre@@ b announced that there is no hurdles to give up the tide of Slovenia for the North without hurdles .
but the route is still dangerous .
Croatia wants to be permanent with the neighboring Slovenia on the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .

the EU , desperate to Croatia , is not a Schengen country for Croatia .
after the end of Serbia &apos;s Serb , Hungarian border has broken hundreds of refugees to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe .
500 people were above the line at To@@ &apos;s feet , reports of the film &apos;s television station R@@ T@@ L .
Hungary had cleared its border for refugees .
moreover , new laws that took place on the same day , moreover , make decent asylum @-@ seekers cases in Hungary .
Croatia wants to let the refugees happen .
is the possibility of this possibility . you can go through , and we can prepare for that possibility .
these people are , and they are women , children , and men who live and do .
but people who do not want to live in Croatia .
the People &apos;s police had the first refugees to join Serbia &apos;s border to the EU - the country &apos;s neighboring country .
most of the most recent media reports is from Syria , Iran , and Afghanistan .
it came from both the B@@ us and Ta@@ x@@ s in the Serbian border city Si@@ d .
immediately after the arrival , they would have tried to take root on the Green frontier to Croatia .
on the Cro@@ atic East , Serbia &apos;s border is not confined to cross @-@ border .
there are other risks here : there are sharp mines from the Yugoslav civil war in the 1990 &quot; s .
as soon as a safe passage is supposed to be quickly .
after the border , after the closure of the border .
in the service , the police provided 3@@ 66 recorded people .
shortly before the folly on Mon@@ day , 9@@ 3@@ 80 had been 9@@ 80 .
the new Hungarian laws of overcoming the border and humiliation of the border is a criminal offense .
in the South of South town of S@@ alls , therefore , 35 criminal trials have been launched .
the conviction will face prison to five years and withdrawal from the country .
, according to the immigration authority , almost all - 93 - on the most important transition .
two of the cash are 13 families with small children , as well as two elderly people .
on the night tomorrow , there would be 40 refugees .
yet no one has a chance to get asylum in Hungary &apos;s asylum .
according to Bulgaria , Serbia is a &quot; safe @-@ third &quot; strategy .
the focus on asylum @-@ seekers is to be closed to the top .
it was a few hundred refugees before the &quot; Trans &quot; zone ; in R@@ e@@ z@@ ke , only a few hundred refugees gathered .
after all , workers begin to clean up .
they collec@@ ted the waste that have left tens of thousands of people in the street side over the street .
result in the border was built down , and one of the sea &apos;s headquarters was built into the border Square .
nobody wanted no one to say .
, after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , there are few refugees for the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
the country &apos;s 20,000 migrants continued to be in the country for government .
for Sal@@ z@@ burg , for example , 1@@ 400 people wait to move to Germany .
the train traffic to Germany was stopped on the eve of the day .

because Germany had been surprising in Sunday &apos;s border for the border . but , because of the refugee heat of railway traffic with Austria .
even before , we have only stopped the un@@ hoped customers , with J@@ lands and sellers .
we have said , we are bringing them with the car of car .
what was needed for us , of course , was a mistake for us , of course .
they were very grateful .
one man left it not to give a generous sp@@ ap - 100 euros for the fire department .
to be sure , &quot; the city has a very powerful effect . &quot;
the level of land stopped after Germany &apos;s days in W@@ el from a IC@@ E in a regional trip to Germany , in W@@ el from a IC@@ E in a regional trip to Germany , had moved to a regional attack on the border . but , in the short @-@ term period , the spread of land has grown to the border , but it was still trying to try for the border .
on the border .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the cross @-@ border is generally high in the course .
in Sunday &apos;s days , a two @-@ step group - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bav@@ aria .
there is a logical result of hypocritical politics :
rather than helping the camp of Nazism , our Chancellor of the Hungarian government has publicly led to the establishment of the Hungarian government in the establishment of Nazism .
the policy of these policies are not just the Austri@@ ans who are now facing the border in the border areas of chaotic conditions .
also , too , will have to find that the &quot; promised land &quot; that they invited and embrace nothing than another refugee camps .
, given ongoing refugee flows and near winter , there will be a great challenge , given the ongoing refugee flows and near winter to establish human @-@ resource conditions .
and it will be even greater - peace , security , and stability in Austria .

Blackstone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously once the patient is between 27 and 30 .
I think that we get too long before we get people to take it seriously , they said .
I think that once they have put these genetic changes to be linked to obesity and diabetes , a reversal is really difficult to materialize .

to be sure , I have not heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about R@@ ing@@ aya , as she told us 24 : 2 .
I can guarantee that we have not changed our defensive system or the techniques , but in the past six weeks we have made our contact with a real focus , and that has accomplished us .
there has been a little shock to him for three years .
this time is already surprising , as it has always emerged at this time .
B@@ ell@@ am@@ y has the idea of a &quot; exciting football &quot; ; attacked and his mentor , remembered and his mentor , reminds his mentor and remind his mentor , remind his mentor , reminds the Premier League in 2010 with the Premier League in 2010 ; soccer won .
W@@ ay@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
he has been compared to his game on Satur@@ day day , with us on Fri@@ day @-@ day night , and how exciting her game was gone ; I said B@@ yp@@ am@@ y .
I remember that George W. 2010 was criticized as a boring team in 2010 , and W@@ ay@@ ne said that he would care about a li@@ e .
but now he has a team that can play , and that we look as exciting , particularly his young players with their speed .
this is the coincidence of the game that you want to play when it is the kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play his kind of football - not every team , two players , such as Czech ony Mil@@ ford and Ben H@@ <unk> , that they can play as they can play .
I must play against us , because they say it because they say a little worry .
six weeks ago , they probably did not think when it was the Big ones .
B@@ am@@ am@@ y also pointed out that the game played a higher outcome than the game of B@@ ron@@ co &apos;s co@@ on@@ co .
the game &apos;s game was probably a good game , I have not yet been seen , but what was the result ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts in our game , but is the real game ?

I are ready for me .

J@@ V@@ A Berlin .
the federal Constitutional Court was a former member of the judicial system of the judicial system of the judicial system , for a month of a small cell .
in violation of their human dignity , detainees are fundamentally entitled to financial compensation when they are in a small range of cells .
this has ruled the federal Constitutional Court in a piece of decision .
indeed , the judges can even hope for money if they were only a few days in the too few days ( a@@ z ) of 27 27 / 14 ) .
of five square square square sites in Kar@@ l@@ s@@ de : he was in the judicial order of June and November 2009 in a single cell of around five square square square sites ; the to@@ let@@ te had not been cut .
in a larger cell , the man who has come to take a free foot in a wider cell .
his acts of office against the country of Berlin failed .
but the Constitutional judge held the verdict of the cameras of the Berlin , and gave the case back in the case .
they see the human dignity .
Kam@@ le court now decides the compensation of compensation .
even though , for legal reasons , for reasons of legal reasons , only a few days of liability for compensation was the compensation that it meant .
otherwise , a misunderstanding of the rule of law would be to fear .
cameras must now resolve the amount of money compensation .
the constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners .
so they spoke only in April a detainee , because he was imprisoned in a cell .
according to being , a choice of 2011 , according to 2011 , is that there are plenty of a cell without a separate to@@ let@@ te .
in addition to a detainee in a parallel in November 2009 , the Berlin Constitutional court , a detainee in a parallel in November 2009 .

the Berlin prisons were also the headlines in the last few weeks .

Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ;
refugee migration is a huge challenge - the German Chancellor determined to address them .
what comes to Germany ?
around 800 refugees will be able to take a million refugees , according to Deputy Prime Minister Si@@ g@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even in the position to absorb a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) has demonstrated the unusual challenge of resolve : I say and again again : we can create this , and we can create it .
as for Germany , the following survey .
started for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it is built ( 25@@ 0@@ 0,000 homes ) .
dramatically , the country &apos;s lack of housing , and above all , are likely to be an affordable mix of refugees .
is therefore 5@@ 18 million to a billion euros .
invested $ 6.@@ 4 billion per year would have to be invested .
the consensus , and the Federal minister , is that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in housing .
according to the Institute of the Institute for labor @-@ market and professional research .
but the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their skills to help them - the foundation for integration and education .
but it is crucial to the integration of refugees , but whether they find work in Germany .
is the key to social contacts of immigrants , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , the migration of migration tells us like the self @-@ esteem of migrants , says the self @-@ esteem of migrants .
in Germany , there has been a political change in Germany : the authorities banned for refugees to get work .
while the asylum of asylum seekers were limited to five months , this November in November 2014 was reduced to three months .
in society , too , the view that refugees have become more rapid access to the labor market .
a large obstacle to the labor market is a lack of poor .
so far , there is no supply supply of general and professional @-@ related language .
research also shows that jobs are most widely taught by personal contacts .
the building of networks is therefore a view of the royal path to work integration .
the Berlin school administration has found that only a few troubled parents give their children into the glue , an estimated 10 @-@ 15 % : in the absence of parents , it is only very important to hold the family , says , for youth and family in the Berlin Senate .
, however , to convince the family &apos;s benefits from the benefits of the plaintiffs , the administration is distributed in different languages .
if the need to appeal from the large number of refugees is rising , the Berlin Senate would seek to increase educational capacity - for example , by allowing more skilled schools .
in countries , students are prepared for teaching without a few degree of service in Wil@@ l@@ y classes .
teachers are not educated and educated , but in the Berlin , as in Berlin , as in Berlin , as in Berlin , as in Berlin , as in Berlin , as in Berlin , as in Berlin , as in Berlin , as in Berlin , as in Berlin , as in Berlin , as in Berlin , as in Berlin , as in Berlin , as in Berlin , as in Berlin , as in Berlin
there is no shortage of that there is no shortage of touch about the fall of the Berlin school .
the German student paper estimates that about 20 % of refugees want to study in Germany .
in principle , no state of asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception has been Berlin , interior Minister Frank Hen@@ cle ( CDU ) , but has now abandoned his stance .
access to the refugees could be made easier for high school .
for refugees , with the asylum of asylum or tolerance , don &apos;t get a record in the asylum @-@ seekers bill when they begin study .
the latter is basically not a bus , because they do not fall under the circle of ordinary people .
patient refugees had to have lived so far four years in Germany , to be sure , from January 1 , 2016 , from January 1 .
, too , this financing gap , too , must be closed to science , and the German student works .
the students should get B@@ mon .
Islam is likely to play a more important role , because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should be able to develop the same right as a new state , and the existing state - desperate churches - is pressing to a new state .
it is important to the establishment of an Islamic welfare group .
there are responsibilities to the right .
in many areas , Islam &apos;s leaders must be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and give him some control of control .
this includes a willingness to engage with religious fundamentalism .
in the Th@@ urs@@ day , the fear of religious conflict could also be taken into Germany .
given such conflicts in Germany , said that he said in Germany .
he proposed to over@@ ride the Basic Law .
integration will be far more than today &apos;s society .
thus , a majority society will have to change the majority society will have to change the dismantling of discrimination and racism .
Germany - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discriminatory and general law .
but it is very slow , as the N@@ S@@ U has systematically ignored the racist motive , in the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive .
the same will remain true for everyone and the interest interests of non @-@ racial and interest groups , and to use international agreements such as the anti @-@ racial Convention on Germany , will have to become real in the next few years if the country is peacefully peacefully and its new civic citizens are to use their ways - for the sake of all .
generally , Germany is able to provide medical holders so far @-@ awaited refugees .
of course and capacity , we do what is needed , &quot; he told the day .
but more money must go into the system .
in order to avoid bottlenecks in order to avoid bottlenecks .
services could be expected later with the federal countries .
and , in the long run , it is highly doubtful to see so many people with limited performance .
otherwise , in particular , doctors make the language barriers to create .
so far , the Berlin &apos;s health @-@ care scientific philosophy has proven to be found . migrants will be worse off about their diseases than other patients .
not only in clinics , including medical practice , would have to be taken over .
for many refugees , however , many refugees would already pose more general medical councils in the emergency position .
and , with one other diagnostic sight .
there are , for example , much more volatile disabilities , with the young people around HIV .
in part of the other of the disease , German doctors would be aware of their training , but he says that he g@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
America is not so hard to identify , and , for the most part , it is not so difficult to see .
the Syrians would have a advanced educational system , some of the refugees are even doctors .
in order to practice practice , however , they would have to show their skills and may be tested .
estimates at least half of the refugees coming in a few post @-@ traumatic refugees is disorder or under @-@ depression depression ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from post @-@ traumatic stress disorder or depression .
to be particularly vulnerable , the B@@ P@@ t@@ K explains President of B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recent study by the Munich Munich shows that every fifth Syrian country is traumatized in Germany .
those who have a post @-@ traumatic record disorder is suffering , including so @-@ called fan of salt , cheating , heart , and death .
other symptoms are sleep - and concentration disorder , strong di@@ ness , and emotional warfare .
to prevent the symptoms that the symptoms would be chronically would require early treatment .
but so far , only four % of refugees receive psycho@@ therapy .
true , in addition to psycho@@ therapy , the story is typically several months .
moreover , in the welfare of welfare workers or physicians who are not educated for mental illness , whether treatments is necessary or not .
this often leads to miscalculation .

Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe holds wrong speech in Parliament .
but , in the early year , Mugabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell to a po@@ dium .
he remained silent , but the fall of the event spread quickly over the Social media .
the parliament &apos;s opening of the parliament has also been tarnished by claims of legislators of the opposition that they had had anonymous death threats , and they warned that they had been warned of sending Mugabe with Bu@@ hr@@ ations .
last he repeated him , and he was interrupted by his speech to the nation in parliament - that is the speech he repeated in the service .
the speaker of the Movement for Democratic Change ( the champion for National Change ) In@@ no@@ <unk> G@@ on@@ ese said that , for example , the speaker of the Movement for National Change , In@@ no@@ <unk> G@@ on@@ ese , said that , for example , there are seven opposition to the task of the Exchequer for the sake of seven opposition - a politician who has warned them to disrupt Mr. Mugabe &apos;s silence .
the message ; the message comes from a number that he said , but it said the title of Mugabe ; death , he said , said of Mugabe after Mugabe &apos;s speech .
it warns the affected parliament - members that the immunity to parliament ends , and once they leave the parliament to leave their parliamentary immunity to their parliamentary immunity .

few have pointed out to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September , and if his rehabilitation is due to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario has already meant that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will miss at least the next four games for England , and , given its involvement in the next summer , his involvement in the European Union will certainly be uncertain .
the great shame in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had returned to the old season after a separate season , and then came to its old momentum during the pre @-@ season season .
so &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ;
it is a bones that is not good .
this is not a bigger matter .
this was only a accident .
it was not connected to its cows , or with the injuries he had before .
this may be true players , but as a few also acknowledged , there is a risk of further injury , whenever a player tried to return in the midst of the season .
it is evolving to an uncomfortable pattern .
23 years ago .
he was also played in just 65 of the arsenal in the last five months .
the broader picture of arsenal is that they were clubs at six times since 2007 / 08 since 2007 / 08 , one of the two Premier League .
few have accepted the potential of a vicious circle , but it believes that improvement over the last season will continue during the last season season .
when you strengthen your body , you have a time for a time , a time when you strengthen your body and take on combat power ; he said .

I hope that his body is stabilized , I am confident that he will do it , and he will be a career of the kind he deserves .

&amp; nbsp ; I try to keep the balance , and the players who need to keep a small dose of clubs , said little .
although the arsenal of the arsenal is clear , the group of the group is being heard in a group of Z@@ agre@@ b , with the greatest scare effect in Europe .
after @-@ 41 games have been launched . the campaign has been launched in the last season .
the St@@ adi@@ on was struck by an earthquake , with the judges of the Ju@@ ala ala .

the absence of similar representation in Kat@@ w is obvious , particularly in terms of how to open the desire for men to open up as a desire for men to open up , now more desperate than ever before , and more desperate than suicide rates of young men in a 15 - This year .

for those who are not depressed , a circle of mental @-@ healthy friends kill the risks of mental problems .
but , of course , one can only have friends to work with a friendship .
in the age of social media communications , with its emphasis on style , the answer is often more important than a more significant contact .
our digital lives have the need to look strong , even if isolation dominates isolation .
this superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call to call for personal development ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of superior values - our internal desire for personal development and friendship , focusing on our mental health .
and , as a video game , invent@@ ors and billionaire , recently said , money cannot buy happiness .
the beauty at stake was that this focus was put on its head .
each character was defined not through his work , but by his personality that the interaction as a friend is a friend &apos;s friend .

but , while they got the point , it was not a small ass@@ es@@ et of Laur@@ ent , and later in the game of his home city .

instead , P@@ S@@ G himself took on , with some failures and bad degrees , not least as five attempts in the first half , and then abandoned , after producing ani launched him after the start began .

Klaus &apos;s post has written the introduction and up@@ date .
the word ?
no , not by Ot@@ mar images .
at the start , the image of Ot@@ mar A@@ les , which has been formulated in 150 motives , was his own personal interpretations of bibli@@ cal stories on paper and L@@ ab@@ a .

on the contrary , these issues are quite bleak .
around the many three years , &quot; the book of all three books .

by doing so , he has consistently been fascinated by several partners : this is not the case for the removal of the game , for example , with his emphasis on art books , as well as for the C@@ ese .
and there is , above all , the author of Klaus .
he has been interpreted in current contexts , and so forth in the current context .
these texts are like verbal mirror of Al@@ ch@@ Mal@@ esy .
to be sure , they are between the original al - and , at the other time , a phrase of the artist who put it to be a matter of personal thought for the situation .
there .
as a result of the 75 , it allows a deep glimpse into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high level of insecurity .
emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bi@@ ble - The project : Ot@@ mar A@@ les , 1940 was born in advertising custody , and took in Berlin , comes from a family committed to the strict Protestant wi@@ p - the head of his head .

the government will also ease controls on companies and make sure that companies will decide how to run their business .
the statute also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .

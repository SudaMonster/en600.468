Obama
least between Obama and Netanyahu is not a mere one .
thing to be adopted about implementation of the international agreement , as well as on its own of the Middle East &apos;s actions .
but it is to be said to be a solution to the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ discussed two @-@ state states - the states of the Americas - to avoid the conflict .
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu .
with Netanyahu &apos;s lack of peace in the peace process .
the deal with the deal surrounding Iran &apos;s nuclear program has worsened the two @-@ further relationship of the two .
in March , Netanyahu had been reluctant to be an invitation to the Republicans of the US to the US in the US - Congress issued a controversial speech , which was viewed as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not met with Obama , a meeting that was rejected by the upcoming election in Israel .
an emergency call for his friend to his friend .
in a state @-@ sponsored call , professor Sh@@ F@@ on Lam@@ b , a somewhat z@@ ci@@ gue voice of the police that he had shot his friend , would have to shot his friend to his house .
family inter@@ mon@@ te might be found in a hand@@ y . &quot;
within the House , officials found the light of am@@ y P@@ ren@@ ti@@ t , and a hand@@ d note that was a white bloc : Mi@@ r , who was a white bloc , was to be able to do so : Mi@@ r is so tired that the first woman was ever to be und@@ ed : and , according to the authorities , I have ever signed me .
there was no indication that Lam@@ b , who is in two online , is already sl@@ p@@ yed for the delta State University in C@@ le@@ vel@@ and , Mis@@ si@@ ssi@@ i , and , for the police , to the police , where he was killed a popular history professor , E@@ hal@@ ate , who killed his office in his office .
the E@@ w of State University of police chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief chief , the university of the university , said that the university of the university - the shooting 10 @-@ hour - is the first one .
he said that Lam@@ b has made the disastrous emergency story at some time .
until the end of the day , there was another death : Lam@@ m took him in his life when the police denied him .
a day after the l@@ w@@ o in the university , students , and D@@ oc@@ ers , forced to hide behind closed doors , and the authorities still try to hide a picture that the lam@@ b were motivated .
the details of both the state &apos;s subjects and those who knew him , as they did , as was what students and workers who knew him , helped to be an image of a talented but possibly difficult teachers .
students &quot; pay were happy .
the police in the street , where p@@ ren@@ ti@@ died died , said that he has no history of violence or a criminal history .
the Chancellor himself was mentioned in a &quot; name &quot; he was mentioned in a &quot; name &quot; he was mentioned in a &quot; name &quot; he was mentioned in a &quot; name &quot; he was mentioned in his own book he was the &quot; wonderful people &quot; who he shared his academic life .
both under@@ educated in the Department of social sciences and history , which includes a teacher among 17 members , and many students visited their students .
too , some tendencies have been made with problematic behavior .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ a , who praised Lam@@ b , said that he seemed to be a little more honest and nervous about whether something was wrong with him .
another student , S@@ el Sy@@ , said that Lam@@ m told him that he was asking at the end of the academic of 2014 - to do with stress .
Lam@@ b had asked the delta State University to ask for a mere health reasons , saying that he had some health problem .
little just put two online in this year - the world &apos;s stock prices .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policies meant that the pro@@ bility of the lam@@ b had worked so hard for him to provide a automatic path to a automatic path to a automatic path to a job as an additional @-@ called professor .
in the wake of the day , the President William For@@ te said that he wi@@ ars nothing from a conflict between Lam@@ b and Schmidt , but , of course , there was something in an attempt to do so .
thing &quot; questions are questions that the lam@@ b can no longer answer .
after the flight , the police found Lam@@ &apos;s track later when he was re@@ ordered in Mis@@ si@@ ssi@@ i of Ar@@ kan@@ ssi@@ y .
before he could be arrested , Lam@@ b murdered himself with a car@@ le south of his home house , a tiny @-@ south of the town of Gre@@ K@@ lle , Mis@@ si@@ ssi@@ i , said Washington Coun@@ ty Cor@@ z@@ methane .
his car went back in a ticket .
it was not immediately clear to see the lam@@ b , but Johnson said that he knew people who lived there .
Lam@@ b grew in the area .
Lam@@ b began his work at the University , which 3,@@ 3,@@ 500 students in a city with roughly 1@@ 2,000 inhabitants , and under@@ directed geography and educ@@ ators .
he was in P@@ ago@@ gi@@ k .

Car@@ la H@@ do@@ ston said she was 15 and lam@@ m , when they met with common friends .
they and their friends were in the high school , and he was the co@@ ole older Ker@@ l who tried to bring back to the back of the bars .
he was the female Empire back then .
all girls were going to see when he was , and , now , 40 and in the West &apos;s town of Brand@@ on , the girl &apos;s city .
obviously have been a case of time and p@@ ren@@ ti@@ s .
in the emergency call Lam@@ b said , I said that my wife killed were killed , but there was no ancient public @-@ fire .
they had a dog called Li@@ gh@@ a , who lived with them in the B@@ aven@@ stone &apos;s name , who played on a Ba@@ b in his hands .
in order was the dog .

it was not enough to do so ; you were not destroyed ; St@@ ew about his daughter .
they and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &amp; # 45 ; St@@ ew said that he never made lam@@ b , but he was he he was he heard that Lam@@ b was interested in music and blu@@ la@@ es .
Lam@@ b met p@@ ren@@ ti@@ ang , when he and A@@ bi@@ g@@ ine both two years ago , for a summer of global @-@ market war .

there was no sign that something was wrong .
not just a happy couple said .

I think they had good sense for their own .
the Chancellor professor , the dead professor , launched the first @-@ time semin@@ ar@@ Program and specialized , and speci@@ alized , said of Mitchell , a English , and a professor of the school .

the company said that the next month will begin to begin with candidates , and the number of thousands of October will increase until December .

Michael J. Fox h@@ u@@ se his &quot; D@@ ate &quot; with a ro@@ p @-@ co@@ ana .
the Pre@@ ber of the game was a big moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
I am a &quot; us &quot; in theater to Royal , and I realize that the seat is empty alongside me , and I am beginning to realize that the seat is empty , and it is beginning to be clear that the seat he is empty , and it is beginning to be clear that the next @-@ seat stay , he said , he said that he said in a tra@@ il@@ on , he said , and

it is not enough to be a matter of &quot; It &apos;s &quot; ; it is said , and the biggest time in prices - the film , which ever turned to the ever being turned .
the answer is to be seen in a hur@@ ry , D@@ VD , and in a year @-@ October movie .
that is not a military solution in Syria .
Secretary @-@ General Ban Ki @-@ Kahn - It says that his response to Russia &apos;s greater military support for Syria is : there is no military solution ; and more weapons will only make violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN is asking , for all parties , including the UN &apos;s divided , the world &apos;s largest , to unite , and to support inclusive negotiations on the Fin@@ ve of a political solution .
ban , a press conference on the Middle East , is that he plans to meet the foreign minister of the five permanent member states - the United States , Russia , China , Britain , Britain , and France - on the verge of the General Assembly in the first century to discuss the situation in Syria .
he has been biased that the divisions of the Council and the regional powers are getting to be able to do so .
ban called for five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity that have demonstrated in the negotiations of a nuclear deal with Iran .
thing is seriously shown by the world &apos;s leading to 8 @-@ level .
to put him as a fl@@ op .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
some await a collapse .
but , however some Republicans try to draw Donald b@@ der @-@ down Donald wards , it has not worked .
ten of the last 11 national polls showed Donald t@@ der , and some begin to wonder seriously , which means the opportunities of the real estate &apos;s nomination - the Mo@@ ok@@ ary .
visible in the election &quot; is too early .
nobody claims that , most likely , the Republican nomination will likely win .
experts stress that the time in 2011 was po@@ ked in the wake C@@ ain in 2011 , which no one state was won in the process of nomin@@ ating .
there are many reasons .
but outsiders like Jean @-@ Bush &apos;s super @-@ Sup@@ PA@@ C and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now now recognize a lot of du@@ ve and start to bring off their dollars to topple it .
here , some recent poll numbers suggest that real estate is not just a temporary period :
180 degrees have turned 180 degrees .
soon before Donald , his candidacy announced in mid @-@ June , showed a survey of Mon@@ ay - the University of the only two of ten Republicans to the real estate - the Mo@@ gu@@ l , that only two of ten Republicans were the real estate - the Mo@@ gu@@ gu@@ l , who saw real estate , was positive .
by mid @-@ July , it was 40 % .
52 % were 52 % in early August .
@-@ now 6 Republicans have a positive view of Donald degrees .
three of 10 say that they have a negative opinion .
the numbers .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ se ac - the presidential vote in last week found that 60 % of Republicans have a good say .
two @-@ thirds of the G@@ O@@ P - the G@@ O@@ P would be happy with t@@ t@@ ty than candidates .
the last week , 67 % of Republicans predicted that they were either too much , or &quot; c@@ d@@ s ; &quot; if a threat @-@ by @-@ board @-@ up @-@ up @-@ up @-@ up @-@ up @-@ up @-@ up @-@ up @-@ up @-@ up @-@ up @-@ up @-@ up @-@ up @-@ up @-@ up @-@ up @-@ up @-@ up @-@ up @-@ up @-@ up @-@ up @-@ up @-@ up
only two of 10 say they would be a recipe ; they were angry , if he would be the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son is creating roughly the same enthusiasm as the equivalent of the divide ( 43 % say they would be a &quot; 43 % &quot; ; they were not enthusiastic ; and 40 % , which say the same thing in the same way ) .
the next thing in enthusiasm ?
with the 21 % Mar@@ co Ru@@ ac@@ ent .
on the other hand , 47 % of Republican voters say that they are being unhappy ; or , if so , Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
majority a majority see a lot of temper@@ ament .
while Donald Con@@ der is widely criticized for his grandiose and offensive statements , 52 % of Irish voters believe that the real estate is a right temper@@ ament for a president , so A@@ BC News / Washington Post on Mon@@ day .
the same number is true in the first of the nation &apos;s first decision @-@ state state , the state of state , where the same 52 % of Republicans think that he has a single @-@ seat @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ k , week .
still , 44 % think that he was not the personality to carry out effective power , and almost six @-@ 10 % say that his temper@@ ament does not go into the White House , so A@@ BC / Post .
Republican voters get accustomed to the idea .
Republican voters are running in real terms when they put their own their subjects to their own .
when they are asked who the most likely the G@@ O@@ P - the nomination wins , the best bet is that , according to a BBC / F@@ C poll , the best bet is that it was the best bet .
this is a change since the time four from 10 end of 10 ended their money on a mere Bush .
full disclosure : G@@ O@@ P - the head of the past not the clearest crystal ball in the past .
at this point last , four of ten Republicans thought that the nomination would win the nomination only 28 % for the final candidate Mitt Romney .
yet a host of G@@ O@@ P is showing that a number of G@@ O@@ P is a serious view .
, even if Republicans are losing a different candidate , there is almost everyone .
some experts suggest that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to a massive role , while the anti @-@ Americanism - the threat of the International States - is likely to be more than a dozen other candidates .
in early September , but the head of the Americas is the main race between the fact and most other Republican candidates , a coalition that is left to a hypothetical head .
he has made 13 points before Mar@@ co @-@ D@@ li@@ ina 13 points , a leading @-@ 15 point , before the first @-@ century Bush , and finally , and , finally , Paul , John Yor@@ e , and Chris .
it is an head of the game - the head of the game - to create a head of power - the head of the game with T@@ C@@ C@@ ru@@ z .
the only candidate that suggests him ?
Ben Car@@ son would make the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head - the head of the situation - to make the race .
a close majority of Donald challenges - &amp; nbsp ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; #
a new survey by CB@@ S / N@@ Y@@ T on the service shows that only more than half of the electorate who support the most recent support say that they have their votes .
to be sure , much can be done to change that , and nobody can never say that it never to change .
46 % said that they can let the door open to change other candidates .
but the strongest competition in the moment of the other outsider , the neur@@ och@@ ent term Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say that they have formed their opinion are twice that of a tail@@ y .
related to be presented with a related @-@ based @-@ based @-@ trade issue .
since Donald t@@ der in his campaign for two months ago , Donald t@@ der immigrants were out of Mexico from Mexico , with the fact that the immigration was the whole and the no@@ pin of the public discourse .
some worry that the bombs of bas@@ tic out@@ am are used to create a crucial @-@ based call by the Republican Party and the new @-@ scale efforts to damage .
but , after the new A@@ BC / Post , six of 10 Republicans say that they agree with a related @-@ related issue .
control migration in the spotlight , Donald t@@ der seems to be doing .
.
by Donald t@@ an and Ben Car@@ son , roughly half of the support of Republican voters , especially by their outsiders , is being challenged .
six from 10 Republicans say in the new mon@@ day - the main survey of A@@ BC / Post , they prefer to prefer a political maver@@ ick than someone with government experience .
they are also angry to Washington .
a survey of D@@ ag@@ an &apos;s , and Bloomberg in two weeks ago shows that three of four &apos;s state - Republican Republicans in Congress are frustrated by 54 % , with 54 % , and 21 % , and 21 % , and 21 % , and 21 % .

to avoid the dispute of the dispute over the proposed transatlantic Free Trade Agreement T@@ T@@ er , the EU has proposed a major commission to establish a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ tive system .

since his election , the Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ yn@@ s &apos;s De@@ eh@@ t is expected to be expected to the Fra@@ ge of prime minister , with tension .
the new Labour , the head of the Federal Labour , is supposed to give his de@@ we@@ ur at the Fra@@ ship of prime minister , and for the first time David Cameron took .
as the first one is to ask the first one of his six @-@ year issues soon , his performance is likely to be re@@ tested by the media and the Labour - as they are now tested .
thing &quot; demanded , fewer theater and more facts were being demanded .
he has said that he could be able to step out some meetings .
the Be@@ er@@ ement will be the first parliamentary test for the next Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s , because it comes after his appointment to a member of the shadow and after his speech on the T@@ UC - at the end of his appointment , the meeting of his death .
meanwhile , the decision of Labour &apos;s decision to the Kremlin &apos;s decision to the Kremlin &apos;s staff - the main chairman , who was in charge of the National an@@ b during the Indian Party &apos;s death of the National an@@ b at a 7@@ th anniversary of the B@@ am at a 7@@ 5@@ th anniversary of the B@@ am at a 7@@ th anniversary of the B@@ am at a 7@@ th anniversary of the B@@ am
the slogan of Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ &apos;s decision not to be a national an@@ b has focused attention to the drawn from attention to the drawn .
cor@@ B@@ n said that he had been a &quot; respected &quot; ; he had been a respected of respected and he had been silent ; heroism &quot; the Royal &apos;s heroism in the air C@@ la@@ ts in the air Re@@ la@@ ts in the air Re@@ la@@ ts in the air Re@@ la@@ ts . &quot;
but a member of the De@@ Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s , O@@ whom Smith , the BBC , presented in the BBC , the New York , who had been the national an@@ b , &quot; the national an@@ b , &quot; he said that the monarchy was abolished , whatever the belief that the monarchy should be abolished .
nearly a dozen of shadow - the United States refused to serve in the case of Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s &apos;s top team , and they are calling for differences in the economy , defense , and foreign policy , while less than one @-@ sixth of the parliamentary Party initially supported him as leader .
the political cor@@ c@@ ine Di@@ respondents , the Egypt &apos;s political cor@@ c@@ ces , says that political differences also been re@@ sized within Labour ; and , for the sake of Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ &apos;s remarks to become the European Union &apos;s position and limit .
as cor@@ B@@ n told the T@@ UC , Labour Conference that Labour changes for a limit to limit the whole idea of a limit .
hours later , by the time , by the time , the shadow of the country , the shadow of the country - the country &apos;s labor and pensions - the party , is a clear minister that they should be willing only against the government plans to cut limiting 2@@ 3,000 in 2@@ 3,000 .
the fifth Labour will be the fifth Labour , as Chairman of the David Cameron , David Cameron , who has been his head of the last decade about the dispute , the last decade of the presidential struggle .
Labour &apos;s main support - the head of another policy @-@ policy facility says that he was being asked to be the first @-@ handed , the notion of questions on Mr. Cameron , and has given more than 30,000 dec@@ ads .
the Is@@ ady ton of Is@@ ady ton has said that the prime minister &apos;s fragility is too , and that he will stop and move with dissent , and instead to focus on serious problems like poverty , inequality , and challenges for young people .
as the case of Cor@@ B@@ n has said that , Angela E@@ ag@@ le , the shadow of economic support , will be represented of ministerial support if he is not included - for example , when Mr. Cameron is on the corner .
he also has expressed the idea that other colleagues take the word , and that he was watching John Ber@@ mer , the speaker of the House of the House , to discuss the problem .
when he was leader in 2005 , Cameron Cameron said that he was himself to be a &quot; @-@ style &quot; policy , a cas@@ per@@ le - the cur@@ ed of the prime minister , which is often linked to the Fra@@ ship of prime minister , but some years later , he later said that he failed to do so .
since the end first in 1990 , the Fra@@ ship was seen as the main bar@@ ometer of the ruling of a leader and his position under his parliamentary House , as the main bar@@ ometer of a leader and his position under his parliamentary House , though critics have argued that they had become a caric@@ ature and needed reforms .

a country &apos;s reputation , a country &apos;s main security adviser - the security security Office for Orban , said that the authorities have already been able to cross 45 &apos;s border , and have been more deeply integrated into the country .
they come through by failing to damage the fence , now in police custody , and are being blamed for criminal courts .
authorities are quick to repair the fence .

choice - the head of Hillary Clinton &apos;s head of Ber@@ nie S@@ different from the national poll in the national poll is hal@@ ved by 2016 .
former US , for Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , continues to keep a double @-@ digit margin in the democratic race to the national nomination , but Senator Ber@@ nie no &apos;s side is gaining their way to the ground .
Clinton has now gained the support of 47 % of the democratic electorate in the primary ( 58 % ) , while S@@ different is second , with 27 % ( rising by 17 % ) .
vice President Joe Biden , who has not yet announced that he is running for the presidency , receives support from 15 % of the country &apos;s democratic voters .
more than five months before the start of the primary front , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinions is what they will support .
thing &quot; the other candidates &quot; vote are more than the other candidates .
the CB@@ S has been the Clinton survey since the CB@@ S - the News News - has lost Clinton on a series of demographic groups , while S@@ different gains have been in line .
Clinton holds a large margin in women and moderates , but that lead has been reduced .
while their support for men has fallen significantly , and S@@ different is back to 5 points .
the benefit of democratic voters under 50 years has evap@@ orated , and they and others are now equal .
voters .
last month , Clinton was in charge of the two @-@ month gains in liberals , but S@@ different has now taken a 5 @-@ presidential point - the main point in this group .
for half of the democratic electorate , about half of the primary national electorate , they would support the party that they would support .
a quarter would support them with some cav@@ eats , and another 15 % would support them only because they are the candidate .
six % would not support them .
in the case of Clinton &apos;s current supporters are not surprising .
views are more mixed in those who currently support Clinton - only about a quarter , for example , a quarter of a quarter .
whereas 48 % of the French electorate say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , fewer Republican voters say that , as a result , less Republican voters are talking about their top presidential candidates , Donald t@@ der ( 35 % ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question , why they want to see the right experience is that it is the right experience that it is time to have a woman ( 13 % ) , and that it is the best candidate for the job ( 10 % ) .
Clinton &apos;s backers also mentioned their association with Bill Clinton ( 9 % ) .
allocation , to deal with problems and di@@ titude are also being cited .
as President president accuses a potential for the presidency to the next ag@@ l , 57 % of the electorate &apos;s Democratic electorate want to see him in the race - though one @-@ third believes that he should not do .
if democratic voters are asked to the primary party , who would be their second choice , is a lot of the top .
that , they would be far from being different .
if Biden chooses to run out not for the Democrats nomination , Hillary Clinton &apos;s head of S@@ different , from 20 points , is raised with Biden in the race for 30 points .
twenty @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chance to win , but that number of 78 % last month has fallen last month .
Biden is a second @-@ sum game , but the percentage that it is as the most votes of the electorate .
nevertheless , when the question is what is more important , Democratic voters call issues about voting .
the case is not a single democracy candidate or potential candidate for these voters as unacceptable .
Democratic candidates or potential candidates are providing good results among some important features in voters &quot; primary Party .
strong and Biden as honest and trust and strong leadership is the Clinton @-@ chan@@ leadership .
, the three candidates is the best option .
thirty percent of democracy &apos;s voters believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy , twice the same story that the story ( 15 % ) , but 27 % have no opinion of him .
democratic voters in general view Clinton , S@@ different , and Biden , in con@@ formity with their views .
on all of these measures .
because questions about Hillary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e - a desperate to ask - the notion of the moment and a ser@@ ade during the term as Secretary of State , most Democratic voters are satisfied with their explanation , saying that it does not affect their opinions .
but it is a different story in America &apos;s public .
least one @-@ third is satisfied with their explanation .
public opinion was in March in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the E is asking - the hard controversy - the controversy that has not had a implications on her general opinions by Clinton , though 36 % said that their opinion has worsened .
it is mostly Republicans , more than six to 10 , that their views of Clinton have become worse .
although Clinton is seen as honest and trustworthy by voters &quot; voters , this remains a problem for them under a single @-@ party voters : only 32 % see it as honest and trustworthy , eight % less than last month and 15 points less since May .
election election voters do not think for a honest and trustworthy person .
at the same time , 55 % of the voting vote are seeing a mere 55 % as they are not honest and un@@ trustworthy .
later , however , is good No@@ ts in leadership .
@-@ wing candidates are being met with honesty .
a majority is more likely to be honest than honest , but , as with Car@@ son , many do not think he .

Fed will raise interest rates .
hike hike , and homeowners will fal@@ ter , yields on bonds will rise , and the economy will become mired in recession .
we know that .
we do not know how long it will last .
even for the economy .
rate in a recession came to the first rate of interest @-@ rate hikes , and lasted 86 months .
the Federal Reserve &apos;s aggressi@@ veness is often , if not always , one factor how the economy and financial assets respond .
as a result , US officials have been so intense that investors should not focus on raising interest rates , but rather on the period that need to norm@@ alize .
indeed , several variables play a role .
end &quot; tax rate may be exaggerated .
and , as the Fed &apos;s first increase since the global financial crisis , the first increase in the Fed since the global financial crisis is inevitably likely to be a signal for the end of the era of the era ; cheap money , &quot; said , &quot; the chief economist in Capital Economics , in a university citizen .
by contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US - to normal levels , but still at low levels , to fear the rest of the rest of shock that many seem to fear .
there will not be a effect on the ground . &quot;
thing could respond to historical trends .
as the market has seen in the last month , the pre @-@ reliance of raising hikes can be volatile for a while .
influence is not so much as raising entry .
there is , no surprise , a tendency that asset spending will be re@@ planted after 24 months after the first increase , which may be re @-@ delay in monetary policy , and perhaps again , the central bank - the Central Bank , said , and the Fed &apos;s monetary policy , predicted , and , in a recent study , what has happened to Fed interest rates .
more specifically , the market has been in the last 35 years , for about 14 % , on the path to hike interest rates , rather flat , and then to the rate of the past six past cycles , and then to the normal days of a total return in the last 35 days , with a average return in global p@@ ve@@ es , the world &apos;s largest @-@ estate estimates , the head of the day
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on stocks tend to be later in the wake of the cycle cycle , and the return on the return to reduce .
to promote economic life .
in the current case , the Fed faces some conditions that would not have been in place , and that could accelerate a recession .
most importantly , GDP is close to the lowest rate of interest rates in the Fed &apos;s interest rate .
about the 1@@ 18 rate hikes since 1950 , nominal GDP has been below 4.5 % .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 % , few expect that this will last , and expect only 1.5 % for the third quarter .
interest rate in so fragile economic vulnerabilities could be risky , raising the question of this time , said the Deutsche Bank said .
market participants have been taken on an interest rate in the Fed , and all eyes were at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in this week , which ends the D@@ urs@@ day .
while many strategists and economists believe that the &quot; B@@ M@@ C &quot; might approve a spike in this session , the futures - only one likely 25 % probability .
&quot; in our study , all the wave of recent @-@ day cycles cycles in 1950 to today , the report , has taken place , and , in the face of , has taken place in the aftermath of the recovery , &quot; the report &apos;s report .
by contrast , this is a clear slow recovery , which was the worst recession in the interwar period .
the current cycle is far the longest , the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and so far have been 74 months .
it was also volatile , because the market is becoming an interest rate , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the impact on bonds is faster than if their strategic course are changing .
bonds seem to shift to change as soon as the first increase in the cycle comes .
&quot; the ban@@ w@@ thing cycle &quot; is immediately coming down , the Deutsche Bank said .
as strategists of Charles gays believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to higher returns between longer and shorter bonds , leading to a decrease of its curve .
often , high @-@ rate bonds often yield better returns in such a climate , although we are still cautious about to expect higher returns , said K@@ ue , Fi@@ z@@ an , Fi@@ z@@ ws , and , in a sense , the p@@ st@@ n is p@@ st@@ p@@ ing in a analysis .
interesting , then , that markets already have adapted to Fed - the strategy of pressing for expectations .
but the market &apos;s strength and the decline in inflationary expectations , some signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy , and they wrote .
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the green recovery has been expanded , and volatility has been increasing , and volatility has been increasing , when the Fed is tightening its strategy .
and all of all of their business @-@ sector activities will benefit if interest rates rise and local products more attractive .
multinational companies with large debt are worse off , as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive to the global market , and to finance its debt .
moreover , history shows that quality - quality - stocks , for three months after an initial rate hike , is extraordinarily positive to respond to three months after initial rate , predicted Goldman Sachs - a fiscal analysts report for customers .
firms with a strong record have exceeded a weak record in corporate @-@ rate increases , 1999 , and 2004 , on average , by 5 percentage points .
high capital is liable to create high capital - and their stock @-@ rate volatility , with lower quality at average ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage ) .
debt will be a big problem .
businesses , with a high proportion of flexible interest rates , will lose most , said Goldman .
the dollar will benefit from the rise in the US .
savers could see profits from higher returns , even though experts are different , how fast .

according to the leader Robert Ri@@ ff@@ el , the defendants found in the suburbs that the defendants were used to take money from the United States accounts in 2006 to 2011 , which they were allowed to make their functions to the private purposes .

when he started last year , a figure was about 1@@ 20,000 euros to the balance account in the year .
these were saving , the defendants explained .
this securities account went on the names of the second accused , and was that it was not known .
&quot; ? &amp; nbsp ; &quot; Why ?
the answer was long .
the best of this .
if he happened , nobody would have known something of this money , the prosecutor was told in the room .
complicity was informed , the official official justified .
that over@@ allocation was considered to be re@@ stated .
harm ?
the first defendants said that he was not approved by this formulation because the lack of never was damage .

Germany &apos;s cautious prudent Chancellor Angela Merkel is a allies , but it is a allies for 10 years , and wants to be office before it looks ill to be seen as the office , and ( 16 ) , Mitterrand ( 16 ) , and Kohl ( 16 ) .
French François Hollande is looking back to his re @-@ election or his re@@ writing in 201@@ 7 .

they can recall weak in Boris Johnson , the first to call for the creation of the euro - the creation of the euro - the International Monetary Fund , which is a name as a &quot; one @-@ time &quot; - the proverbial p@@ p@@ ors that has been a name as a &quot; one @-@ time &quot; - &amp; nbsp ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp;

it may take a coherent strategy to win the media , but it must be developed by a coherent strategy to win the media , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC has been asking , and certainly , with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC is asking , and leave a firm .
Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s &apos;s official position to Europe is - I make it benign - in the development .
we should remain in a reformed EU .
now , outside of U@@ dy@@ or@@ y traditional blan@@ ar@@ ws , most people outside the traditional blan@@ ac@@ ings of traditional blood - the tendency and wild their pra@@ des to the ch@@ mon@@ ley &apos;s - is likely to say any yes .

aid for fighting was still more appealing .
but , to fight , for all circumstances , and not to be a matter of conduct , the phrase was not what Mc@@ Mc@@ D@@ ell said , and legislators after all their claims on their full @-@ day @-@ day @-@ day day on Mon@@ day day .
whatever the success of the success , the main engine of Cor@@ B@@ n &apos;s arrival - the first @-@ time image of Cor@@ B@@ n - is thinking that he is asking I , think that he has even been getting me , and , in the era of the soci@@ al media , a breeding ground of paranoia and betrayal .
it is correct to give Cameron no free card for Europe who allows him to keep Lab@@ support for granted to a war , as Mc@@ D@@ t@@ ell said .
Simon J@@ ew is sure to think .
but Mc@@ D@@ t@@ ell and Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s fundamental multi@@ tensions to the EU - for example , - to be sure - is no longer only a matter of es@@ ot@@ stic discussion among leftist dissidents , for whom the nar@@ cis@@ si@@ sm of small distinctions is a central principle of dogmatic disputes .
as with its ambiguity of NATO , Watson is convinced that J@@ C will not campaign campaign to leave - will be obliged to seek foreign diplomats to find a sense of their superi@@ ors .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have taken indifferent voters - to make concessions to the British if doing so all sense ?
the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya , and Syria , even with a reduction cut of the T@@ ory - the government of power , which I called at the start of Mon@@ day &apos;s Mon@@ day , called the British In@@ oc@@ ence Forum .
experts criticize the report of Public Health England on e @-@ making -
claims of government @-@ funded agency that em@@ e@@ --@@ the damage for cigarettes are less damaging than smoking was born from a meeting of 12 people , partly with links to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( B@@ M@@ J ) , a petition , and the UK &apos;s general Health England ( PTAs ) , a petition occurred in the report of the National Health England ( PTAs ) , to criticize cigarettes .
the &quot; board &quot; issued by the &quot; Intergovernmental Report &quot; issued him last month , and describes him as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
but some researchers have challenged the resilience of the data and have been pointed out to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
a editorial in the medical journal last month , the country &apos;s most important conclusion was the driving .
two other researchers write into B@@ M@@ Y , and have asked whether the claims are &quot; or not building on either or sand .
Martin Mc@@ Ke@@ e , professor for European Public health in the London School of Hy@@ giene and Tro@@ p@@ ers , and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , professor for mon@@ om@@ pool , said : a fundamental principle of public health is that policies based on the evidence of effectiveness should be .
they said that the public expects the argument that the argument is expected to be the case that the present estimate is that the current best estimate is to make the world &apos;s e@@ estimate - the equivalent of 95 % less damaging than smoking , on a detailed review of the margin and Mo@@ del@@ li@@ zation .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were called to develop a model for a ambiguity of ambiguity - the M@@ CD@@ A - to develop a synthesis for a single @-@ pronged strategy - the meeting of meeting was published in a research report .
Mc@@ Ke@@ e and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a firm or a company called a firm called the euro &apos;s body was to be given by British American official official funds ( asked ) for an independent study .
he also signed the benefits of asked for public health in a sustainability report , said they .
one of the 12 participants in the meeting , said to keep funds from a e - aid to keep cigarettes - but not funding , which he is supposed to have been used to receive the tobacco companies , who had previously been used to have been issued by the tobacco companies Philip @-@ based International .
the reasons for the members of the body &apos;s members will not be met , but it includes several prominent em@@ ges - the proverbial culprit that some of them have been used to provide a industries - to paper finance .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know of their know - the country &apos;s tobacco control .
the meeting , too , tobacco is a part of the tobacco .
the group &apos;s research work is telling ; it is telling ingly to be that there is a shortage of harsh evidence to the most products most of the products ; there are , Mc@@ Ke@@ e and Cap@@ e@@ well .
we are discussed not of these links or restrictions on the part of the PTAs .
to spend , Mc@@ Ke@@ e and Cap@@ e@@ well said that the claims of the PTAs has been to be turned out .
Pro@@ f of F@@ ent@@ on , director for health and well @-@ being at the staff e , said that the claims of B@@ M@@ Y has been addressed before .
he said : &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp
each second life smokers die .
all evidence suggests that the health risk of E is being left - the equivalent of cigarettes are small compared to do so , but that we continue to have long @-@ term effects .
the clear duty to know the public about what the evidence is evidence , and what is not , especially when there is a relative risk of public confusion about relative dangers in comparison to tobacco .
nearly 80,000 people die each year in a disease each year , and smoking costs two billion dollars per year .
the clear evidence of evidence that it is to avoid - no amount of cigarettes , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking is our national responsibility .

the former head of Ch@@ Z@@ el 4 , Lu@@ ke Johnson , the BBC should stop using programs like E@@ ast@@ i@@ des and The bird ice , said that commercial rivals would be able to do so ; the first @-@ right thing would be to make a lot of the sort of H@@ it - as a result of the Albert .
Johnson said that the TV used to make the kind of programs that do not have been used to be used to make the kind of programs that do not have to be used by other UK .
he criticized the BBC that they publicly to secure publicly - the legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard @-@ controversial periods of the most popular and broadcast @-@ 4 @-@ like @-@ like @-@ like @-@ like @-@ like @-@ like @-@ like @-@ like @-@ like @-@ like @-@ like @-@ like @-@ like @-@ like @-@ like @-@ like @-@ like @-@ like @-@ like @-@ like @-@ like
after the BBC is the world &apos;s largest director , Tony H@@ all , said that companies wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he had tried for six years in his time to have tried for six years to come with the BBC six years at Cheney &apos;s time .
I have been a recipe for me that the BBC has issued programs , or send to the House that was clearly not subsidized rivals , but Johnson told the upper house - the International Committee , which was clearly not subsidized rivals , and send the House of the House to the upper house , the Ministry of the BBC , as part of his investigation over the future of the BBC .
when you wish to keep the TV , what I do not want to see for a good idea , or in the long run , you should at least to programs that do not make others or spend .
they send The Vo@@ ice into a first @-@ rate window of time because they want to achieve the lowest broad support for their future .
the idea that no one else would show that is a joke , of course , is a joke , of course .
Johnson said : I don &apos;t see how a re@@ gressive tax is financed programs that could be financed without subsidies .
the bird ice is such a program , E@@ ast@@ ent@@ ent@@ ders , another , admittedly both of their productivity .
the honestly would be honest .
least he should be the publicly able to see this publicly .
not believe that this would actually reduce the BBC .
Johnson , a entrepreneur of S@@ ain@@ , who began to do the Ch@@ ann@@ el 4 of 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC was blamed for ratings , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support .
his comments to the most popular S@@ am@@ sis of the BBC have given the return , which the former head of sk@@ y , Tony ball , in his Mac@@ meeting , the BBC , suggested that the BBC should sell a series of the BBC &apos;s like E@@ ast@@ En@@ ent@@ ine .
Johnson said that the sooner - the establishment of the game - the establishment of the Americas , the establishment of the Americas , and they should do the same public @-@ minded @-@ care programs , and they can argue that if they are not measured by the audience , they have a common sense of these ar@@ urs programs that no one has seen .
they are entering a window of time in which nobody wanted ever to see .
as the first @-@ quoted prize Johnson put the committee : I urge to find a more re@@ gressive system in terms of conditions that can be paid to take the best value .
of course , you think everyone , think that one of the great value for 150 per year is a great value , but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 billion of $ the world , I wonder whether they consume not much of the BBC .
the former Sk@@ y@@ y@@ --and and Ch@@ Z@@ el 5 , the leader of David El@@ stein , who was also told the committee of the paper , demanded that the BBC should review its rice - the mission of mission , and to inform them .
he said that only the BBC - and it would now be - for an official 1 % of their TV - and it should be used to do so - to be held by the public - and they should be in the public , openly @-@ wing TV , and Canada , for example , and to do so .
the list of the partnerships , the BBC , should do more in areas like the pro@@ an@@ er that he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and with commercial TV farms to make all online online .

it remains clear that anyone who wants to give an asylum request , so it could be taken to be taken .

&quot; We have heard that Hungary has made it back , so the police said that we should go back here , &quot; he said of the refugees .

it would not be very large refugee numbers .
they could not say whether they would continue their journey about Hungary , Croatia , or a different country .

in most expected meetings , Federal Reserve headed this week around a 27 - call for Honduras - Mahmoud Mah@@ sti@@ i - the best meeting to decide whether it is time to raise the rate of the first time for the first time ever since .
it is a United States &quot; picture of the United States , two @-@ looking customs of customs as a world &apos;s moment .
the map is a reminder that the Fed is making the way to do - the head of Chairman Jan@@ et L@@ et L@@ ern@@ es and their colleagues to the nation &apos;s interests of the nation all of the other things .
the central bank has a double mandate of Congress : maximizing US employment and prices stable .
but , since the Great Recession , the Fed has acknowledged leaders that there is an unwritten third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the main goal of the X - a factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict it , which is being known to predict the unprecedented incentive to be reconciled by the pre @-@ zero interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the data in economics show that they can be solid , the recent turmoil in global financial markets could make the Fed &apos;s already prudent Fed - the world &apos;s inability to increase these volatility by raising interest rates for federal bonds - and was just one @-@ quarter point .
to be sure , the labor market and inflation will primarily be the most important thing they see , said Lin@@ dse@@ y &apos;s <unk> p@@ g@@ za , chief of the game company , and Co@@ ck@@ y .
I am , however , if they were looking for a pretext not to raise the interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is not enough to wait for the global market , said it .
there is no consensus about what the Fed will do , which is spreading by the financial market .
for example , the economists have predicted that this week &apos;s recent @-@ economists rate rate have been written recently .
financial markets , however , expect a Fed wait to be a key % chance of an increase in the Fed .
this suggests a decline in the stock market , if the Fed increases the raising the price that it is , to promise that a further increase is far from being .
on the Dow , the Dow Jones , the Dow Jones , was 2@@ 2@@ 8.@@ 6@@ 6@@ th points , or 1.4 % to 16@@ .@@ 5@@ 9@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action has caused expectations that the Fed has been asking - the politics he put in this week &apos;s policy week - said John London &apos;s chief economist at Moody &apos;s &quot; the chief economist economist in Moody &apos;s &quot; Capital @-@ A Research Group . &quot;
it would be surprising if the Fed pushed rates to this point ; he said .
if they do it , she would have to go very far in their Declaration to calm financial markets , lest them into panic .
other experts argued that the rate hike would calm down financial markets , because they will eliminate uncertainty about when the Fed will act .
even before a month , the Fed seemed to raise good ways to increase the rate of 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tightening of the monetary conditions that the strength of the recovery in the US would test .
Y@@ f had been said that , despite the complaints of liberals , they were told that more economic progress would be needed to raise the price of the economy .
although job creation slowed in August , improving the labor market was solid .
the unemployment rate fell to 5.@@ 1 % last month , the lowest since more than seven years , and near the Lev@@ ration that the Fed is at full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and , while inflation has been running the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the Fed said that the main reason for the temporary price of oil prices was far lower .
the economy is going to be addressed ; higher interest rates can deal , and it needs them for the labor market , said I@@ an &apos;s no@@ d@@ son , the chief economist at the pan@@ the@@ on , .
but financial markets around the world last month , after China devalued its currency .
the Dow Jones average fell more than 16 % in May , when investors feared that a slowdown in China &apos;s economy would slow global growth .
this month , the market has something recovered this month , with the Dow now running by almost 10 % below the H@@ oke .
for the Fed , market turbulence influence the complex calculations of when to raise interest rates .
moreover , if events in financial markets and the news about the Chinese economy &apos;s weakness in the last few weeks were not , the meeting would not have happened in this meeting , said , by the time , Stephen D. O@@ N@@ <unk> , the Sen@@ <unk> Research fields on L@@ L@@ A Z@@ im@@ an Center for the real E@@ ad and a former staff of the US Federal Reserve .
now he says that they will wait at least a month to tackle the impact .
there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US will be to be the world &apos;s outcome - the economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data that is what matters in China are &quot; ; &quot; said O@@ .
none of the world economy &apos;s health is not the primary concern , so it should not be included as a technically important role in its decision @-@ making .
Fed has become the world &apos;s currency authority .
the central bank &apos;s influence has been enormously in recent years .
the mere evidence of then @-@ then Ben Bernanke &apos;s then @-@ chief Ben Bernanke &apos;s just indication in 2013 that the Fed could &quot; produce monetary expansion &quot; ; it could cause the world &apos;s entire financial expansion .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined , the Fed can be expected to be turned by the Fed - the world &apos;s leaders are expected to be used to monitor not only developments in others , but also with other central banks and experts to maintain a better understanding of the global economy .
their decision @-@ making is a lot of art , said Z@@ ach@@ ary , head of the global strategy for the wealth management of the company &apos;s wealth management .
Jeffrey L@@ u@@ er , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Justice , noted that the Fed is leading to a history of over@@ @-@ scale financial @-@ market efforts - the movements that apparently do not seem to be linked to the economic fundamentals .
L@@ v@@ er , the head of the Federal Open Market Committee , is a case for hike hike , cited decisions in 1998 @-@ 1999 .
a financial crisis in Asia has brought the Fed to cut its policy rate rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three meetings , despite limited implications for growth in the US ;
a year later , the Fed made the Fed - the most important representatives to back this cuts .
the Fed should take aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis like the market crash of 2008 , said Adam P@@ Po@@ sen , the former member of the Committee on interest @-@ rate setting up in the Bank of England .
the recent turmoil is not near the level , he said .
I certainly want to be in the situation , which they fear a rate hike , because markets are going to push up , said , the president of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the Federal Reserve Act is still the dual mandate , and does not mention financial stability , and it does not believe that they should be expected to predict .

because of the extra energy , the more energy will be to increase the pregnant and young mothers , their daily calculations , to raise about 500 cal@@ ories per day .

encouraging weight loss of loss of loss can help .
the benefits of the weight loss of weight for slightly over @-@ extended people with the 2 2 diabetes can take at least five years after a new study .
it is too early to say whether easily over @-@ weight people with diabetes on the weight of loss @-@ taking care is longer living for the longer than those who do not support - when they receive surgery for surgery .
in fact , the level of data need a long time to show a bit , and Dr. Finance Blackstone , a expert of the weight loss , is ch@@ w@@ ch@@ ch@@ an , which wrote a editorial to the new study in J@@ A@@ an Sur@@ o@@ an .
weight - the loss of responsibility , the loss of power , and A@@ di@@ m of Japan - is ch@@ w@@ ge@@ ent the threat of a variety of ways to shrink the size of the Ma@@ x .

for years , A@@ di@@ ly of Japan &apos;s main nuclear @-@ policy operations - the prevention operations to treat the type of type - has been to be a efficient diabetes , but most studies have been carried out by people who are ill @-@ ob@@ ese , and most studies have been carried out by the disease , and the size of a Bo@@ dy - the E@@ M@@ I ( B@@ M@@ I ) , from 35
B@@ M@@ I , a measure of weight in size , is normal to be normal between 18@@ 5 and 2@@ 4.@@ 9 .
a B@@ M@@ I of 25 or more shows that someone is over@@ weight , and people with a B@@ M@@ I have more than 30 .
they can be set on your B@@ M@@ I : 1,@@ us@@ a@@ a@@ .@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from Taiwan &apos;s M@@ im - the E@@ eng general of the data that has been conducted since 2007 , and compare two types of A@@ di@@ sh - the proverbial 2 @-@ page of medical treatment - the proverbial 2 @-@ 2 diabetes - the proverbial diabetes in humans , which were easily over@@ weight .
the average B@@ M@@ I , which included this operation , fell from 31 to 2@@ 4.5 to the end of the fifth year .
meanwhile , the B@@ M@@ I remained the case in which not the main cause - the Social surgical diabetes - the treatment of the treatment of surgery , with 29 @-@ sum treatment roughly the same way at 29 29 .
among those who undergo surgery , 36 % of diabetes is now being destroyed - the disease illness entirely and 28 % .
the group &apos;s medical st@@ ology , the group , triggered only one percent of total diabetes , and partly for only about 2 % .
moreover , the results of the blood pressure , the Tri@@ c@@ y@@ c@@ c@@ de de and the &quot; no &quot; thing ;
researchers also monitored patients - the st@@ 1@@ wor@@ ys of her@@ mo@@ an , which reflects the blood @-@ induced values over time .
I held the highest rate in A@@ 1@@ c in A@@ 1@@ c , the researchers are set to be below 7 % .
after the operation , the average per capita level of her@@ 1@@ c was dropped to around 6 % .
.
but that better is a better @-@ off control of the game , and the low @-@ speed control of the improved scientist Dr. Chi@@ h - Ch@@ Ch@@ eng - Ch@@ Ch@@ eng - Ch@@ Ch@@ eng and his colleagues .
the research team also reported average results in the two ways of sur@@ ge@@ gy .
in the fifth year , the B@@ yp@@ ass of Central - Ch@@ ge@@ gy - the United States , the most weight in the host record of the host record , has lost more weight ( 7.@@ 4 % ) , and a total cut ( -@@ 4@@ 6.@@ 7 % ) , compared to a total ( 4 % ) , and a total cut ( 4@@ 6.2 % of 16@@ .@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study has no survival advantage of the ch@@ ge@@ gy of the ch@@ ge@@ gy of the past five years , there is evidence of a study of un@@ spe@@ ic people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says by the University of Arizona , college of P@@ ho@@ ho@@ x .
in Sweden &apos;s study , it was in the number of people who have been a a@@ di@@ sh of Japan &apos;s main - and surgery , for example , more likely to die over 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods .
although the new study does not have an advantage for survival at the Ch@@ ge@@ gy of the ch@@ ge@@ gy , the patient showed that it was reassuring for people with a B@@ M@@ I , under 35 , who are interested in the trial .
what is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation in this low @-@ line B@@ M@@ I - the country &apos;s lower @-@ M@@ M@@ I - is a lower group of low @-@ level , without risking a risk of death or a kidney disease , they said .
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously once the patient is between 27 and 30 .
I think that we will have too long to do people to take this to take them seriously , said they did .
I think that once they have given these genetic changes , which have linked their body with obesity and diabetes , a reversal is really hard to do .

but now he has a team that can play and we see as an exciting , particularly his young players .
it is the chess game that wants to play .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play his kind of football - not every team , two players , such as the Czech ony Mil@@ ford Mil@@ ford and Ben H@@ an , so that they can play like them .
I build stronger trust because they say that things are , because they are a bit worry to play against us .

the game of the B@@ ron@@ es was probably a good game , I have not seen , but what was the result ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts at our game , but is the real game ?
so is a bit of tension ?

this may be true of purely medical view , but , as a few also acknowledged , there is a risk of further injury , whenever a player tried to return in the middle season .
an uncomfortable pattern is emerging .
the study of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ k L@@ t@@ d , 23 , has been reported by Wil@@ sh@@ d , from Wil@@ sh@@ ere , six years ago .
he also played only 65 of the arsenal of the past five months .
the broader picture for the arsenal is that it was in six periods of time since 2007 / 08 , one of the two Premier League , which have seen most vulnerability @-@ up .
few have accepted the potential of a vicious circle , but it believes that improvement in the rate of vulnerability in the world &apos;s vulnerability is likely to last over the last season .
if you return to injury , you have a time time , a time when you strengthen your body and take on combat power ; he said .
that is manageable .
I hope that his body is stabilized , I am confident that he will do , and he will be a career of the sort he deserves .

for those who are not depressed , a circle of mental healthy friends is half the risks of mental problems .
, friends can work .
in the age of the social media , communications , with its emphasis on substance , the answer is often more central than a significant one .
our digital lives have the need to appear strong , and , if in fact , isolation dominates isolation .
this superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call to call for example of psychologists . money , image , social status , all of the costs of values , and friendship that affects much deeper outcomes on our mental health .
but money cannot buy good luck , as a video match .

to be invested for three years in the personal interpretation of Bi@@ ble in his personal interpretation of Bi@@ ble .
Jesus with the ( ver@@ or@@ ated ) village one is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar A@@ les for his Bi@@ ble has been made .
after the introduction of writing and bi@@ b@@ ws have been updated .
the word ?

his &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; The C@@ ep@@ ts of color and imagin@@ ative forms has given the 75 - what is hardly synonymous with the level ; images .
thing adjust .
for example , Ot@@ mar A@@ wa@@ an &apos;s be@@ ble has been able to work - the project project that he is a simple @-@ minded call - the most important choice of the many issues of the many issues of all books .
it was cycles that are exposed to the issues like the cross@@ way , p@@ est@@ es , and our to address our attention .
he has been fascinated by several partners : the first point of the White @-@ term empire - the catalyst of his theological orientation as well as for the C@@ ese , the main point of his theological orientation as well as for the C@@ ese , was his focus on art books .

I have tried to work to work to the Mr. father .
his second concern is to get the art in the late time again : the perception of today &apos;s people is now shaped by the politics , and that is , according to the point .
there is no symbolism of symbolism .

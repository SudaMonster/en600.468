Obama is asking .
not just the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu .
the two wanted to talk about implementation of the international agreement , as well as on the Middle East &apos;s efforts to act .
but , in order to be resolved , it is meant to be a conflict of the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two - the states of the Americas - to avoid the solution .
in years , the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been .
Washington has criticized Israel &apos;s lack of settlement in the peace process .
the deal with the deal surrounding Iran &apos;s nuclear program has worsened the two further .
in March , Netanyahu had been reluctant to be an invitation to the Republicans of the US Congress - Congress issued a disputed speech , which was part as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not met with Obama , a meeting that has been rejected by the upcoming election in Israel .
in a emergency call , a woman who has shot his friend shot .
in a emergency call , professor Sh@@ F@@ on Lam@@ b , with a somewhat z@@ ci@@ ous voice of the police that he had shot his friend , and that officials would have to come to his house .
Lam@@ b was important to emphasize that the &quot; southern dog &quot; ; the South of the likes , and he said that family marriage could be found in a hand@@ y .
&quot; the authorities &quot; was signed to the letter , and he was signed by Lam@@ b .
there was no indication that Lam@@ b , who is in two online , will have had 300 miles to the delta State University in C@@ le@@ <unk> and , Mis@@ si@@ ssi@@ i , and , in the case of a popular history , E@@ as@@ a , where he was asked to the police , killing , and killed his office .
delta State University of the Exchequer , J@@ ford said that the university of the university - the shooting 10 @-@ clock - is the ones .
he said that Lam@@ b has made the disastrous emergency story to come .
by the end of the day , there was another death : lam@@ m took him on life when police were afraid .
a day after the shooting at the University , students and D@@ oz@@ ators , forced to hide behind closed doors , and the authorities still try to hide themselves an image of what the lam@@ b were motivated .
the details of both the details and those who knew him , as they knew , helped to be an image of a talented but possibly difficult teachers .
students said that they were happy to his teaching .
the police in the Indian sciences , where p@@ ren@@ ti@@ died died , said that he has no history of violence or a criminal precedent .
Chancellor himself had mentioned the book in a man @-@ read book he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people ; &quot; he said he shared his academic life .
both under@@ educated in the Department of social sciences and history , whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students visited their students .
there were some dis@@ problematic behavior at the same time .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ a , who praised the lam@@ b , said that he seemed to be a little more than a good and nervous about whether something wrong is wrong .
another student , S@@ el Sy@@ ke , said that Lam@@ m told him that he had been the end of the academic year of 2014 - to do with stress .
Lam@@ b had asked the delta State University to have a pen@@ ur@@ ance on health grounds , saying that he had any health problem .
this year , he was only two online .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policies meant that the pro@@ o@@ lity had worked so hard for him to provide a guarantee of an automatic path to a automatic path to a job .
the culprit of the day - President William <unk> For@@ <unk> said he said nothing from a conflict between Lam@@ b and Schmidt but , of course , there was something in a British Lam@@ y .
is no longer answered .
after the flight , the police later discover Lam@@ ls when he was re@@ planted in Mis@@ si@@ ssi@@ i of Ar@@ can@@ on .
before he could be arrested , Lam@@ b murdered himself with a car@@ le south of his home house , a sl@@ ist@@ y in the town of Gre@@ K@@ lle , Mis@@ si@@ ssi@@ i , said Washington Coun@@ ty Cor@@ z@@ methane .
his car went back in the opening .
it was not immediately clear why Lam@@ b was going to go , but Johnson said that he knew people who lived there .
Lam@@ b grew in the area .
Lam@@ b began his work at the University of 1@@ 2,000 people in a city of around 1@@ 2,000 people and under@@ directed geography and educ@@ ators .
he was a pro@@ ago@@ gi@@ k .
one of the longtime friends of Lam@@ ch called him as smart , charismatic , and in@@ al@@ sive .
Car@@ la H@@ do@@ ston said she was 15 and lam@@ m 20 , when they met with common friends .
she and their friends were in high school school , and he was the co@@ ole older Ker@@ l , who tried to bring back to the bars of a few years ago .
he was the female black .
all girls were going to go when he was a &quot; one @-@ time &quot; ; he said H@@ do@@ ston , now 40 and in the West &apos;s town of Brand@@ on .
Lam@@ b and p@@ ren@@ ti@@ des were obviously some .
in the emergency call Lam@@ b &amp; nbsp ; I have killed my wife ; but there was no ancient public @-@ born .
they had a dog called Li@@ gh@@ a , who lived with them in the B@@ aven@@ stone of Central War , who has been drawn to a Ba@@ beat in protest .
the police said that the dog was in order .
the former - the E@@ ren@@ ti@@ s@@ son , Sha@@ W@@ O &amp; nbsp ; St@@ eums , said that she had been detained 15 years ago , but friends had remained and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
it was not a mistake for you ; you was the land ; you didn &apos;t say ; St@@ gh about his daughter .
she was , and her mother , were absolutely best friends .
O &amp; # 160 ; St@@ ew said that he never made lam@@ b , but his daughter , A@@ bi@@ g@@ no , has heard that Lam@@ b was interested in music and blu@@ la@@ es .
Lam@@ b hit p@@ ren@@ ti@@ ang , when he and A@@ bi@@ g@@ a three years ago , when he turned out of three years ago , the world &apos;s main market .

P@@ ren@@ ti@@ was , a nurses in which various companies are online online .

there was no sign that something was wrong .

8 poll show that Donald is serious .
some have tried to get him as a fl@@ op .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some await a collapse .
it is not working , as some Republicans try to draw Donald t@@ der from the top .
ten of the last 11 national surveys showed Donald t@@ der in double @-@ digit terms , and some begin to ask seriously what it is in the real estate &apos;s chances of the real estate &apos;s nomination - the Mo@@ ok@@ ary .
it is , of course , early in the election &quot; s .
nobody is likely to win the Republican nomination .
experts stress that the time was the rising C@@ ain in 2011 , which no one state was won in the process of nomin@@ ating .
there are many reasons why he would have a general election .
but outsiders , like Jean @-@ Bush &apos;s super @-@ Sup@@ er Bush &apos;s super @-@ F@@ k , now recognize the country &apos;s reputation and start to bring down their dollars to topple it .
here , some recent poll numbers suggest that real estate is not only a temporary phase :
the price ratings have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald President Donald his candidacy announced , a poll by Mon@@ ol was a conclusion of the Mon@@ ol - the University of the German economy that only two of ten Republicans were the real estate - the modus Mo@@ l , who saw real estate - the modus Mo@@ l was positively regarded .
@-@ of @-@ July had 40 % .
August , it was 52 % .
now six Republicans have a positive view of Donald t@@ der .
they have negative .
these numbers are in the early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ c of the Republicans , the presidential vote in Iowa last week , found that 60 % of Republicans have a good opinion of the fact .
two @-@ thirds of the G@@ O@@ P - E@@ O@@ P , G@@ O@@ P , would be happy with t@@ t@@ ty than candidates .
in a 2003 / F@@ C poll , 67 % of Republicans said that they were either a &quot; fan@@ d &quot; or &quot; ; &quot; if a threat @-@ by @-@ board @-@ to @-@ be .
only two of 10 say they would be angry ; if he were the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son creates roughly the same enthusiasm as a divide ( 43 % say , they were &quot; with &quot; 43 % ; &quot; they would be lu@@ pped down ; less than 40 % who say the same about a more than a ro@@ le ) .
the next thing ?
21 1 % .
on the other hand , 47 % of Republican voters say that they are being unhappy ; or , if the Bush @-@ led Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be a candidate .
a majority of the Republicans .
while Donald widespread statements is widely criticized for his grandiose and offensive statements , 52 % of the Irish electorate who have been criticized for a president , the right temper@@ ament for a president , the A@@ DC News / Washington Post on Mon@@ day .
the same number is true in the first post @-@ election state state , the state of state , where the same 52 % of Republicans think that he has a stake , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ k , week .
nevertheless , 44 % think that he has not been the personality to carry out effective power , and almost six to 10 % say that his temper@@ ament does not go into the White House , so A@@ BC / Post .
Republican voters get accustomed to the idea .
when they put their own their subjects , Republican voters hold a big difference for real .
if they are asked who the G@@ O@@ P - the nomination of the day , the United G@@ P - to a BBC / F@@ C poll , the two week that is the best bet on the ground .
this is a change since the time four from 10 end of 10 ended its money on a mere Bush .
full disclosure : G@@ O@@ P - the eurozone &apos;s most clearly qu@@ ball did not have the clearest crystal ball .
at that point last cycle , four of ten Republicans thought that the nomination would win the nomination only 28 % of the final candidate Mitt Romney .
yet a number of G@@ O@@ P - the campaign of a campaign is that a number of G@@ O@@ P - the country &apos;s campaign to see a campaign as plausible .
even if Republicans are con@@ eling by another candidate , there is almost everyone .
some experts suggest that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to a strong problem , while the anti @-@ Americanism - the threat of the Americas - is a more common candidate than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey of Mon@@ ging .
thing , and Chris Big @-@ scale , he has been a major point before the first @-@ up Fi@@ or@@ ina .
it is an head of the game - the head of the responsibility - the head of the Americas , the head of the game , and the T@@ C@@ C@@ z &apos;s head of the world is a head of purpose .
the only candidate that suggests him ?
Ben Car@@ son would make the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head - the head of the situation - to make the race to the fore .
a close majority of Donald challenges - the threat of wi@@ st@@ an - is telling fans that they have formed their opinion .
a new poll by CB@@ S / N@@ Y@@ T on the service of the service shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support the st@@ st@@ ure say that they have their votes .
of course , much can be done to change this , and nobody can never say that it never to change .
46 % said that they can let the door open to change other candidates .
nevertheless , the strongest competition in the moment of the other outsider , the neur@@ och@@ ent Ben Car@@ son , who say that they have formed their opinion , are twice as frequently t@@ tly .
six of 10 Republicans say that they are related to immigration with a related issue .
two months ago , the immigration was the &quot; and Angel@@ ran@@ pin in the public discourse . &quot;
some worry that the bombs of bas@@ tic out@@ get are en@@ eling by the Republican Party and the new resistance - the country &apos;s efforts to damage .
but , after the new A@@ BC / Post , six of 10 Republicans said that they are linked to the issue of immigration .
so long as immigration is in the spotlight of the spotlight , Donald it seems to be doing so .
frustration on the government is soaring at the highest levels .
in Donald t@@ son , and Ben Car@@ son , roughly half of the support of Republican voters , especially through their outsiders , is becoming a source of status .
, with government experience , the new mon@@ day .
they are angry to Washington .
a poll of D@@ <unk> &apos;s <unk> / Bloomberg two weeks ago shows that three of four &apos;s Iowa - Republican Republicans on Republicans in Congress are frustrated by 54 % - dissatisfied , and 21 % , and 21 % , was angry .

besides he is a fan of a fan that sh@@ wed the former @-@ minded torture of the Mal@@ stic US - the state of the state of Sciences , with fil@@ z@@ z@@ ft , has created .
40 persons , for example , is almost half of the Stevens .
he tells out by various places that he has repeatedly re@@ ared on the map , which report his min@@ li@@ al and z@@ ci@@ ous words .
where they were born and how it looks like .
has proven itself to be a miraculous .
in 2003 and third Al@@ bu@@ m &apos;s &quot; third Al@@ bu@@ m &quot; ; Gre@@ aria &apos;s : the Great Recession of State State , Gre@@ ci@@ ingly , seems to be a wise @-@ minded sentiment that would be very close to American torture of the late 1960 &apos;s , but at any moment in the early @-@ ending dri@@ ves .
it produces the framework , &quot; The size of the road &quot; would be the first part of a watered @-@ off program : each of the 50 US pre@@ DC --@@ the state of states should be held by the state of states .
but , in 2004 and the Rhin@@ eland of the Union , there is already a lot of expectations .
this is reduced to a large scale .

a year later , the number of young musi@@ cians is re@@ turning back to the series .

the Al@@ bu@@ m is rising in America &apos;s Bil@@ y@@ board Char@@ ts , missing in any annual best list of the influential music .
after all productive experiments , Stevens was then headed on the scene , The Age of Ad@@ z &amp; amp ; ( 2010 ) very large electronic Ver@@ ps .
this sixth , a second @-@ profile career , is still in charge , but it is a source of re@@ cutting sequences , or the re@@ ader , and , with all of the effects and H@@ all .
of the smaller clubs , the bus @-@ bashing &quot; can &quot; be turning into a color@@ te spectacle of Ne@@ on - the world &apos;s great @-@ speed bear .
now , Su@@ f@@ an Stevens , as part of a five @-@ member state , is being replaced by Germany .

although nearly 2,000 gu@@ ests are now at their hands , the cra@@ sher of the illusion of so@@ w@@ ning of the establishment are re@@ fl@@ cking back to the in@@ mor@@ lity and torture .
without a word to audiences , the group plays excellent musi@@ cians through the high @-@ enriched bu@@ bu@@ m .
the audience hear that the lecture was &quot; the lecture &quot; ; op@@ ul@@ n@@ n@@ ine and you can be left back to the stage .
only a time to get a long @-@ term rally , a few older foreign @-@ policy is , and , after all , is a to@@ pped to applause .
the prime minister &apos;s fragility of prime minister .
since his election , the Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ yn@@ s &apos;s De@@ ve is expected to be the Fra@@ it@@ t of the prime minister with tension .
the new Labour , the head of the new Labour , is supposed to give his de@@ we@@ ur at the Fra@@ ship of prime minister , and then take at the first time David Cameron .
but , in order to ask the first of his six set questions soon , the first one will be asked to join the first of his six set questions , with his performance of the media and the Labour - and the Labour - to attract the Labour - to dominate representatives from nearby .
he demanded for the sake ; fewer theater and more facts are needed ; the less theater and more facts are going on , with this week &apos;s arrival .
he also said that he could be able to step out some meetings to leave them .
the first parliamentary test of the An@@ Cor@@ yn@@ yn@@ s will be the first parliamentary test for the shadow of the shadow Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s and his speech on the T@@ UC - the annual annual meeting in the service of his appointment .
meanwhile , the decision of Labour &apos;s decision to dominate - the main chairman of the National an@@ b at a mem@@ co@@ th anniversary of the B@@ <unk> on the National an@@ a National an@@ b , a number of T@@ ory - the National an@@ b , a number of T@@ ory - the threat of the National an@@ ne , the National an@@ b , has provoked the criticism of a number of T@@ ory - the
but , not the national an@@ ne &apos;s decision , the national an@@ b has attracted attention to the drawn from attention to the fore , attention attention to the attention of attention .
a speaker of Royal Cor@@ B@@ n said he had been recognized in the air and un@@ ison of England . &quot; he had a respected and respected silence .
but a member of <unk> b@@ yn@@ yn@@ s &apos;s shadow of the BBC , O@@ whom Smith , the BBC , presented the New York , the National an@@ a de @-@ century , the national an@@ a , and the national an@@ a &quot; no &quot; a belief that the monarchy should be abolished .
nearly a dozen of shadow - the United States &apos;s leaders have refused to serve in a series of Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s &apos;s top team , and they are calling for differences in the economy , defense , and foreign policy , while less than one @-@ sixth of the Parli@@ ament@@ Party &apos;s parliamentary Party initially supported him as a leader .
the BBC &apos;s policy cor@@ ac@@ c@@ ine , says that political differences are also coming within Labour , and , according to the S@@ ann@@ yn@@ yn@@ s , the position for the European Union and limit on profits .
as cor@@ B@@ n said the T@@ UC , the T@@ UC was asking that Labour changes to care to remove the whole idea of a limit .
hours later , by the time , the shadow of the country , the shadow of the country , has been the shadow of the party , and the main engine of the party - the Minister of the party &apos;s failure to be very clearly stated that they are only against the government &apos;s commitment to reduce the limit of 2@@ 6,000 of 2@@ 3,000 .
but , as Cor@@ B@@ n will be the fifth Labour , the fifth Labour is the fifth Labour , David Cameron , David Cameron , then his head of the past decade about the dispute of the dispute - the Council is a head of the parliament .
Labour &apos;s main support - the head of a different policy @-@ policy to say that he has promised - the notion of Mr. Cameron , and has given more than 30,000 dec@@ ads .
the Is@@ ady ton of the prime minister is said , and that he will be judged by the prime minister , and instead to focus on serious problems like poverty , inequality , and challenges for young people .
but , if cor@@ B@@ n has said that , Angela E@@ ag@@ le , the shadow of economic support , will be represented in him when he is not included - for example , when Mr. Cameron is on the brink of the day .
he has also raised the idea that other colleagues seize the word , and that he has been watching John Ber@@ ger , the speaker of the lower house , to discuss the problem .
when he became leader in 2005 , Cameron Cameron said that he was a policy @-@ style &quot; s &quot; policy , the politics of a &quot; a &quot; de @-@ term &quot; game - the cur@@ ing of the prime minister , which is often linked to the Fra@@ ship of prime minister , but some years later , he said that he failed to do so .
because they first received television in 1990 , the Fra@@ ship was seen as the main bar@@ ometer of the ruling of a leader and his leadership in the House of Comm@@ ons and his position under his parliament , despite critics that critics have argued that they had become a caric@@ ature and needed to be negotiated .

but Clinton &apos;s backers are more stable than those of the other candidates .
since the CB@@ S has been asking - the News News - the Clinton survey has lost Clinton on a number of demographic groups , while S@@ different gains have been achieved .
Clinton holds a large margin in women and moderates , but that lead has been reduced .
their support for men has been markedly impaired , and S@@ different is back with 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage of democratic voters over 50 years has evap@@ orated , and they are now at equal level .
but Clinton has a big margin among older voters .
last month , Clinton was a different @-@ year margin in the liberals , but S@@ different has now turned a 5 @-@ month call for the US , a key point to the point of the group .
for example , half of the democratic electorate of the primary nationwide national college say that they would support with enthusiasm Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some cav@@ eats and another 15 % would only support them because they are the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprisingly , Clinton &apos;s current supporters are above all of their enthusiastic .
the views are more likely to support them .
while 48 % of the democratic electorate is saying that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , fewer Republican voters say that they are now a prime @-@ candidate candidate .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked to be asked , why they want to see the right experience is that it is the most common answer that it is time to be a woman ( 13 % ) , and that it is time to pay the best candidate for the job ( 10 % ) .
the Clinton &apos;s supporters , too , is mentioned with Bill Clinton ( 9 % ) .
agreement for dealing with problems and the di@@ titude are quoted .
as President president is holding a potential for the presidency in the off@@ ag@@ l , 57 % of the Democratic electorate will want to see him in the race - though one @-@ third believes that he should not do it .
when democratic voters are asked to the Party , who would be their second choice , is a for@@ ard at the top .
Clinton &apos;s supporters say more than half that Biden would be far from S@@ different .
the choice is a subject to run out not for the Democrats nomination , Hillary Clinton &apos;s head of S@@ different , from 20 points with Biden in the race for 30 points .
twenty @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chance to win , but that figure has fallen from 78 % last month .
Biden is a second @-@ sum approach , but the percentage that it has been considered to be the most visible is increased .
nevertheless , with the question of what is more important in one candidate , Democratic voters call questions about voting .
similarly , no single democracy candidate or potential candidate for these voters is proving unacceptable .
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results in some important features of their party &apos;s primary Party .
Clinton , S@@ different , and Biden , consider Clinton , S@@ different , and Biden as honest and trust and with strong leadership .
Biden is best at honesty for the three candidates , while Clinton &apos;s strength is leadership .
thirty percent of democratic voters believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy , twice the same is about S@@ different ( 15 % ) , but 27 % have no opinion of him .
democratic voters in general view Clinton , S@@ different , and Biden .
for all these measures , about one @-@ quarter of democratic voters do not believe that others .
since questions about Hillary Clinton &apos;s use of personal e - the desperate question of - the notion of the moment and a ser@@ ade during the term as Secretary of State , most Democratic voters are happy with their explanation , saying that it does not affect their views on a whole .
I have been in the American public as a whole .
half of Americans now have been unhappy with their explanation , while only one @-@ third is satisfied .
public opinion was divided in March , just after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the E is asking - the desperate controversy - the controversy that has not had a effect on her overall opinions of Clinton , though 36 % said that her opinion has deteriorated from her .
the number of Republicans are mostly Republicans , more than six from 10 , who say that their views of Clinton have become worse .
although Clinton is perceived as honest and trustworthy by voters &apos;s voters , this remains a problem for them under a single @-@ minded voters : only 32 % see it as honest and trustworthy , eight % less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 % of the electorate do not think for a honest and trustworthy person .
at the same time , 55 % of the vote on a large scale are not honest and un@@ trustworthy .
but Clinton and the Caribbean .
of the six officials candidates , Biden , Car@@ son , and Bush are best in honesty .
a majority sees a majority look more like honest , but , like Car@@ son , many do not think he .
the error rate for the validity of 3@@ 51 Democratic Democratic voters is 6 percentage points .
Ben son , in the country &apos;s poll , suggests that there is a visit @-@ on @-@ to @-@ date in nationwide , behind Donald z@@ der , to the tune of Donald Car@@ der .
Ben Car@@ son is in the latest survey of CB@@ S News / New York Times , behind Donald t@@ der Donald t@@ der ,
the two candidates account for half of the voters &apos;s support in the new survey , and others lose dramatically in H@@ old H@@ old , and others lose dramatically in H@@ old H@@ old .
Republican voters continue to be a large number of the large number of the US , which is growing from 23 % in the last CB@@ S - the catalyst that Fox News last month was carried out to 27 % in the poll .
6 % of Car@@ son shot up from 6 % to 23 % .
the poll also revealed that Car@@ son has performed well on demographic groups and t@@ iling with higher education among Republican voters .
the rest of the fields , except from C@@ <unk> Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio - Governor John Ka@@ , is the most deepest , and 10 % support last month , and 2 % support last month .
former Florida - Governor Governor Jean @-@ Bush , the former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ an Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ins and Florida , is now running 6 % on third .
the feu@@ ding of the recent @-@ 3@@ voters on the issue of 3@@ 76 persons in the latest survey is plus or Min@@ us 6 % , and was carried out in September .
the latest CNN / F@@ C - the world survey last week shows that Car@@ son was published in the polls - he sl@@ pped up 19 % support for the Republicans , behind the t@@ aring @-@ up to 32 % support .
the recent survey of A@@ BC News / Washington Post showed a much sign of Car@@ son .

Fed will happen when the Fed increases interest rates .
a hike hike , and homeowners will fal@@ ter , yields on bonds will rise , and the economy will become mired in recession .
we know . &quot;
what we do not know how long it will last , how long it will last , how long it will last .
&apos;s history is low .
a recession came from just 11 months after the first rate of interest @-@ rate hikes and lasted 86 months .
the Federal Reserve &apos;s aggressi@@ veness is often , if not always , one factor how the economy and financial assets respond .
as a result , US officials have been reluctant to focus on the US , which is so intense that investors should not focus on raising interest rates , but rather on the period that need to be needed .
indeed , several variables play a role .
at the end , market participants found that the whole excitement of hike growth may be exaggerated .
in fact , the Fed &apos;s first increase since the global financial crisis is inevitably a signal to the end of the era of the era ; the money is being interpreted , and , when it comes to the end of the era , the economist , the chief economist at Capital Economics , has a fellow citizen .
by contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US - to borrow at normal levels , but still at low levels to fear the rest of the game that many seem to be feared .
no one will be forthcoming .
here is a historical record of historical trends at how some areas of the economy could respond :
as the market has seen in the past month , the pre @-@ term shift can be volatile for a while .
once raising the increase , the influence is not so dramatic .
moreover , there seems to be a tendency that asset @-@ price yields will be spent 12 @-@ 24 months after the first increase , which may be re@@ planted in monetary policy , and perhaps again , the central monetary policy - the Financial ing of the monetary policy - the Financial ing of a recent study what has happened to Fed interest rates .
in the past 35 years , for example , the market is mostly flat - about 14 % - on the way to the rate hike , and then to be a mere @-@ rate of 2.6 % , with an average return in the last 35 days , according to a current analysis in the last 35 days , with a average return in the last 35 days , according to a current analysis in the last 35 days
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on stocks tend to come in the wake @-@ up cycle , and the rate of return is beginning to decline .
recessions are often a fact of economic life , but increases in interest rates are often encouraging .
in the current case , the Fed faces some conditions that could not have been in place , and that could accelerate a recession .
what is highly striking is that GDP will be near its lowest interest rate hike .
according to the Deutsche Bank , the 1@@ 18 rate rate since 1950 was below 4.5 % .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 % , few expect that this will last , and expect only 1.5 % for the third quarter .
interest rates in so fragile economic vulnerabilities could be risky , raising the question of whether this time is different , and the Deutsche Bank said .
market participants have been prepared to raise the Fed &apos;s rate hike , and all eyes were at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on the scene that ends the most D@@ urs@@ day .
while many strategists and economists believe that the &quot; B@@ M@@ C &quot; might approve a hike in this meeting , the futures - only one probability of 25 % .
in the study , all recent cycles of 1950 to the current @-@ day economy in a l@@ l@@ --@@ and facing - the current report , and facing the onset of the recovery - has been growing in our study .
this is a clearly slow recovery , by contrast , what the worst recession was in the interwar period .
the current cycle is far the longest that the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and it has been 74 months .
it was also volatile , because the market is becoming an interest rate , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the impact on bonds is faster than stocks when their strategic course are changing .
bonds seem to shift to the direction , once the first increase in the cycle comes .
at the end of the du@@ w@@ lity cycle , the Germans said .
the strategists of Charles gays believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to a closer @-@ and @-@ shorter bond yields and lead to a decrease in their acts .
high @-@ rate bonds often result in a climate of better returns , although we are still careful to expect higher returns , said K@@ <unk> y , Fi@@ en@@ an , Fi@@ w@@ ning , the most cautious , p@@ ak@@ n , Fi@@ en@@ ating , and a analysis of analysis .
interesting , then , that markets already have a Fed - the strategy of fiscal policy - have adjusted to the Fed .
the market is a few signs that the market has adjusted to tighter monetary policy , which wrote .
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the green recovery has widened , and volatility has risen - all of the market , if the Fed is tightening its strategy .
in large and all , companies who would use the larger share of their business activities in the US will benefit if interest rates rise and local products more attractive .
multinational companies with large debt are worse off , as a rising dollar makes their products more costly to the global market , and as much as financing their debt .
moreover , history shows that quality - quality - stocks tend to respond to an initial rate of three months after initial rate hike , Goldman Sachs , Goldman Sachs , and a report for customers .
firms with a strong record , after every of the rate of interest rates in 1994 , 1999 , and 2004 , in 1999 and 2004 , in 1999 , in 1999 , and in 2004 , in 1999 , and average 5 percentage points .
businesses with high capital - the result of returns and low volatility in their stocks , and their counterparts , and their shares , also hit their counterparts with low quality by the average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
matter , debt will be a big problem .
businesses with a high proportion of flexible interest rates are to be lost .
outside the cash games , consumers are also benefiting by the rising dollar .
savers could see profits by higher returns , even if experts are different , how fast .

and there is a commitment to live - and to be sure - for music and musi@@ , which is really un@@ palatable .
what is needed is the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and work new works , and I said that he said that he is important , he said .

the current process .
according to the High S@@ po@@ ff@@ el , the defendants were emerging in the suburbs that the defendants were used to be money from the 2006 account of the US in 2006 to be used by the accounts of accounts in which they were allowed to provide their functions to the private purposes .

sports officials are charged for financial crimes .
that fact , the leader of the Shah , left the head of the Shah , Justice , Mich@@ a@@ a , in .

at the time of the in@@ fi@@ eness , defense , that the distribution of a wealth was a result of a wealth .
sports officials would have anticipated only p@@ c@@ ations of orders and had invested the sports of sports , for whom they had been working from 1982 until 2011 and invested in the world &apos;s much time and money to have been invested in the debt of the 1990 &apos;s , and invested in 2001 roughly 60@@ 0,000 ( R@@ D ) .
or , as a result , dam as a champion of the situation .
he then decided to take this task .
all risks .
we have been going on , we have said money , to put our life insurance as collateral at the bank , said he said .
it was agreed to the distribution : they can manage the money free , it must not be done .
Wei@@ ein is a harbinger of the transformation of change in order until 1991 .
so some of the transformation in early years later , after 2003 , was paid to pay .

why the payment was not heard in a place had been shown in a way of study , the judge Justice .
the distribution of the story was not interested in the details of financial intermediation , important to the answer .
when he started last year , a figure was over the 1@@ 20,000 of the total account in 2011 .

this securities account went on the names of the second accused , and was that it does not know .
the judge &apos;s judge ?
the answer .
he then said that he was the best for the hol@@ bility .
if he happened , nobody would have known something of this money , the prosecutor was allowed to be in the room .
the former charged was informed , the official official was .
this over@@ allocation was considered to be re@@ stated .
the damage of harm ?
the first defendants said that he had not been approved by this formulation because the lack of never was damage .
but what is to be done when the lawyer says : &quot; the stakes are the ones that you all are coming from the edge of the bargain .
I am a legal leader ?
he said the official he had never been a pen@@ pen@@ pen@@ y of a pen@@ w@@ y , and Di@@ s .
the equivalent of a $ 1,000 per month , however , added the actual cost of payments that it has been much higher .

Moreno suffered a step in the midst of Mexico as Holland - a team played in the World Cup in 2014 .
a great deal is hard because it was not his intention to violate the opponents , and if you hear that it is a very bad thing , it is not well ; &quot; he is a case .
for me , it was not possible to see the moment .

Adam Libya &apos;s case was clearly threatened by the English team , but it is still difficult to make it difficult to find it .
to run Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you are chosen to the former the ball , a repeat of the 3 - the International Monetary Strategy - is not to have the defeat of the S@@ ar@@ ur - The failure of the S@@ p@@ ur - S@@ st@@ ur of the failure to do nothing at my map .
I would not rule out a switch .
A@@ load , perhaps less than the three years ago , may be less learned than the three years ago , but there is a good sp@@ ap in the batteries - the main player in the battery - and the common spirit is strong ; they will not carry a youthful position , only a youthful - welcome to the point .

the related news : Adam Lu@@ th &apos;s v@@ ap from England - the test of turning - the challenge of the world is to be the main cadres , and is replaced by Ale@@ x H@@ ales .
the decision to let the Adam Libya &apos;s decision is , of course , for me as his chief tra@@ ach in the financial A@@ sh@@ sh@@ ire , difficult to analyze .
there were two good @-@ and @-@ difficult conditions at his seven tests , and the easy but harsh reality is that Kri@@ ck@@ ers are designed to results .
there was no question of any question at Joe Ro@@ ot , for example , and that led to the nomination , because - and I said that - players are their own best par@@ lings .
it would have been over the course of Libya &apos;s own fate .
if he hopes to turn another L@@ ade for a White @-@ standing New ire , another opportunity comes .
the England is asking - a tra@@ w of Tre@@ af@@ te , even if he did not perform so good , and that is not surprising ; he is a man of the man .
the question of how much time is to put out - the wi@@ yn@@ mann is to be found to set his mark is difficult .
it was seven opportunities - as the Sam ro@@ ell before him - while N@@ ick F@@ ton .
only a decade &apos;s ton was given the chance to be held and exit .
the only charge that England was able to rise was the first charge in the Caribbean - as close to the highest - but that lost opportunity now lies in the past .
Ale@@ x H@@ ales is a matter of work , and he is a bu@@ cle that I have high .
it is a X @-@ first - the main factor - a strange chess player , which we saw at the time when he saw 2@@ 36 in this season when he had a sp@@ li@@ dge British &apos;s place on a sur@@ li@@ dge British &apos;s place , which was very different .
he must be given at least the same odds as they have received , but this will depend on the team &apos;s team position in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea of using Mo@@ eums alongside a point of solidarity , which is turning an Ex@@ qui@@ ing of an Ex@@ qui@@ t - turning out - the w@@ w@@ ler , and four Qu@@ ic@@ ks would be able to do , and I have nothing to do .
I don &apos;t see why a dark there can &apos;t be met , and this Lin@@ sh@@ sh@@ ans has already shown that he is a vicious illusion of cricket .

he had not returned back .
Z@@ af@@ ar An@@ s@@ ari comes from the cadres as a hedge of the country - the threat to call - and his limited treatment of him has been very impressed by him as a young man .

this was reflected the Med@@ ley of tax - the world &apos;s reputation - the threat of the world - the threat of the world - the threat of the world - the threat of the world - the threat of so@@ ra@@ ra@@ ff , telephone - and the pseudo @-@ pseudo ate - the world &apos;s most large newspapers .
but it is clear that when you are sitting on a cage , you are better distributed to be better ban@@ ished to divert him rather than on his fellow day and at his turn .
indeed , the principle was rejected more than the Blair of Blair himself , when he was rejected Cameron &apos;s referendum on the EU , which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which was rejected him a back@@ door door .
the press never for@@ got him .
but the bar@@ ter Jer@@ e Cor@@ B@@ n , who had been in the back of Mon@@ day &apos;s Mon@@ day , told him that he had no time to waste me - the threat of N@@ .@@ cin@@ ed , the 80 @-@ month @-@ winning approach to repeat the need for me - he said that he was wrong to repeat the need for me , a mistake then and now .
it may take a coherent strategy to win the media , but it is certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC is asking , certainly , to leave the media .
Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s &apos;s official position to Europe is - I make it friendly - in the development .
he says that we should remain in a reformed EU .
now , outside the traditional blan@@ ar@@ ade of traditional blood @-@ makers , the traditional lo@@ st@@ se of the go@@ ys &apos;s traditional lo@@ st@@ ws is a tendency and wild , as well as a mockery of countries , to say yes .
it is what aid is , and you are not a Ben@@ n , but no Ben@@ c of the radio and television in radio and television said that he was not arguing that Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s &apos;s appointment of provocative John Mc@@ D@@ t@@ &apos;s &apos;s appointment was a bad idea .
it reminded me to the 70 - he years when his old father sought to be dis@@ loyal to his Labour - to be the cabinet of his old father , without too far and losing his cabinet .
aid was more attractive .
but , for all circumstances , the question was not what Mc@@ Mc@@ D@@ t@@ ell said , and , for all , the first @-@ day @-@ day @-@ day @-@ day day day , the J@@ C was told his fellow combatants and legislators after all the reportedly on their own sex @-@ day days on Mon@@ day day .
whatever the high @-@ handed nature of the social media - the idea of Cor@@ B@@ n - the best of the day , you think that he has even done me - remember that he has even done me - and , in the era of the soci@@ cal media , a breeding ground of paranoia and betrayal .
true , the right to give him a free campaign for Europe , as Mc@@ D@@ ell , said that he allows to keep Lab@@ support for granted to a war for granted .
Simon J@@ ony is sure to think so .
but Mc@@ D@@ t@@ ell and Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s &apos;s fundamental added contribution to the EU - for membership - is a matter of es@@ om@@ ic discussion of leftist dissidents , for whom the nar@@ cis@@ si@@ sm of small distinctions is a central principle of dogmatic disputes .
foreign diplomats , like its multi@@ t@@ ties to NATO , is convinced that J@@ C will not campaign campaign to leave - will be obliged to try to find a sense of her superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they have taken more wary voters - to make concessions to the British if this can be no longer .

experts criticize the report of Public Health England on e @-@ making - the case of cigarettes to cigarettes cigarettes .
claims of a government @-@ funded agency that the bailout of cigarettes was not less damaging than smoking was produced from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( B@@ M@@ J ) , a petition published by the National Health E ( PTAs ) , to report the cigarettes .
the board is the &quot; Intergovernmental report &quot; issued on the board ; the last month , and describes him as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
but some researchers have challenged the resilience of data and had been pointed out to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
in the medical journal last month , a editorial in the medical journal last month struck the &quot; extraordinarily w@@ factory base &quot; on which the PTAs established its most important conclusion .
two other researchers write into B@@ M@@ Y and have asked whether the claims are &quot; with no stone or sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ Ke@@ e , professor for European Public Health cs at the London School of Hy@@ giene and Tro@@ p@@ <unk> , and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , professor for small @-@ minded am@@ ver@@ es , said : A fundamental principle of public health is that policies based on the evidence of effectiveness should be based on the evidence .
they said that the public expects the argument that the argument is expected to be the case that the present estimate is that the current best estimate is to use the fact that the issue is to use - the equivalent of 95 % less damaging than smoking , and on a detailed review of the results and fashi@@ u@@ fication .
indeed , in a single @-@ year report , the meeting of the meeting &apos;s meeting is a single meeting .
Mc@@ Ke@@ e and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsors of the meeting was a firm called Euro@@ Health Health , whose chief director should be given by British American official funds ( asked ) for an independent study .
he also wrote the credentials of asked for public health in a sustainability report , said they .
one of the 12 participants in the meeting , said that funds of an e @-@ saving - the aid - to preserve cigarettes - the main cigarettes , but not funding , which he is supposed to receive the paper &apos;s tobacco companies , they gave them .
the reasons for the choice of the body &apos;s members will not be met , but it includes several well @-@ known em@@ e@@ s--@@ - to provide the culprit of the world &apos;s - the culprit for the sake of a industry that some industries - including industries - to fund them .
some participants at this meeting are not known for their know of know - the country &apos;s tobacco control .
at the meeting , tobacco was also the culprit - the head of the executive .
the group &apos;s research work is telling , and it is telling that there is a shortage of severe evidence for most products &quot; most criteria ; there are , Mc@@ Ke@@ e and Cap@@ e@@ well .
but none of these links or restrictions on the part of the US@@ E are being discussed .

he said : e cigarettes are far less damaging than smoking .
die in the addiction to each other life die .
all evidence suggests that the health risk of E is being dealt - the equivalent of cigarettes are small compared to do so , but that we continue to have long @-@ term effects .
given the relative public confusion to the public , especially if there is a relative risk of public confusion about the relative dangers of tobacco .
nearly 80,000 people die each year on a disease , and smoking costs two billion dollars per year .
the clear evidence of evidence that E is not without risk - the absence of cigarettes is not without risk but but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we do not meet our national jurisdiction .
the BBC should give up E@@ ast@@ En@@ ders , says a former head of Ch@@ ay &apos;s 4 @-@ 4 @-@ 4 4 4
former head of Ch@@ Z@@ el 4 , Lu@@ ke Johnson , who said that the BBC should stop using programs like E@@ ast@@ En@@ m and The Vo@@ ice , said that commercial rivals would be able to do so ; the w@@ it is asking , as he is to be the case of the H@@ ite So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the TV was used only to make the kind of programs that cannot be dealt with other UK .
- the legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard disputed periods of the most popular rally of their rivals and broadcast like B@@ BC@@ 4 .
after the BBC - Director of director , Tony H@@ all , said that companies wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he had tried for six years at Cheney &apos;s prison , and has tried for six years to come with the BBC .
- I have been arguing with the idea that the BBC has been in mission , or send to the upper house , which , by not subsidized rivals , would be the same thing - the International Committee - to create a new committee in his investigation over the future of the BBC .
if you want to keep the radio , what I do not want to see in a good idea , or in the long run , you should at least be on programs that do not make others or spend .
they send The Vo@@ ice into a first @-@ time window of time because they want to achieve the lowest of the future for their future .
the idea that no one else would show that is a joke , of course nonsense .
Johnson said : I don &apos;t see the question of a re@@ gressive tax program that could be financed without subsidies .
the bird ice is such a program , E@@ ast@@ ent@@ ent@@ ders , another , admittedly both of their productivity .
frankly , other channels would give up their right .
I am I to see how this is publicly about to be done to be publicly challenged .
I don &apos;t think that this would be reduced to the BBC at all .
Johnson , a entrepreneur of S@@ ain@@ , who headed the Ch@@ ann@@ el 4 @-@ 4 4 @-@ year @-@ 2010 , said that the BBC is the best way to work long @-@ term support .
his comments to the most popular S@@ am@@ sis of the BBC , which suggested the former head of sk@@ y , Tony ball , in his Mac@@ meeting , Tony ball , suggested that the BBC should sell a mi@@ w like E@@ ast@@ En@@ m .
Johnson said that the sooner public @-@ inspired - the legal N@@ ical - of the Americas , the legal N@@ ian Strategy - the case of B@@ a@@ 4 @-@ 4 @-@ member programs , and they can &apos;t measure the audience , but they are , of course , to be found by the &quot; all &quot; policies that no one has seen .
they are showing them in a window of time in which nobody wanted to see it .
the committee said that I said the Committee : I urge to find a more re@@ gressive system in terms of conditions that can be paid to the best value .
of course , you think everyone , think that one of 150 per year is a great value , but for people who are money for the 150 billion of $ money , because they do not consume much from the BBC .
the former Sk@@ y@@ y@@ --and and Ch@@ Z@@ el 5 , the leader of David El@@ stein , who was also saying the committee of the paper , demanded that the BBC should review its rice to be able to form and maintain the &quot; too &quot; ;
he said that only the BBC &apos;s only BBC - had already been replaced by the BBC - to provide 1 % of their TV - and to do so - and to do so - and to do so in public - and maintain a example of this change in the public - the public @-@ sponsored TV television in Australia and Canada .
the new Authority , the first @-@ handed @-@ up of the Pro@@ ali@@ stein , should do more in areas like the pro@@ an@@ an that he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and to take alliances to make all online online .

rules for life in the life of student
el@@ el@@ y I remember the self @-@ forgotten smile that I have had - and , for the numerous , long @-@ suffering complaints in a student .
most of what I have learned can be dis@@ ma@@ lli@@ ted in eight simple rules .
the entry in the student of students is easily terrifying .
it is tempting to pregnant : people tell where you com@@ wn , whether you are com@@ om@@ st , whether you are in the case of Cor@@ on@@ n , and why you are going on , because you are going on cor@@ o@@ n , because you are not love in the way you are in the face of cor@@ on@@ n , and why you are going on , because you are not love in the serious
we are told .
and help others to do the same - in which you ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ ts the conversation and helps you who you do not speak , even if your che@@ ers were set fire , and that fire of fire would be .
let you be found .
the tin@@ always turn from people into ghet@@ ators - the Washington &apos;s failure of action , film - This day @-@ making , and communist points , but they are also the jobs where people are competing and their under@@ fl@@ ying .
in the case , you do not think about the relationship with the relationship with start @-@ start .
inf@@ tro@@ p@@ &apos;s , in turn , receive a gross treatment at university .
many student should always be a re@@ b@@ gi@@ um , but many student skills constitute a space - the drive for - the drive of the Americas - the drive for the ground - the drive to create a drive for the sake of a kind of culture - the country &apos;s culture , which is friendly and socially , and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who is trying to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say : I may go you , and I want to leave our friendship , so that I will back away the energy that I have spent on the interaction with you .
try to feel when a com@@ militant one is exhausted by a background - and send him a text @-@ like to a text .
there is a s@@ nu@@ po@@ s : you do it .
a cand@@ l had a cand@@ l in my student of home , the idea that a not @-@ designed door was an invitation .
he looked some things .
the be@@ w@@ lets are closing by B@@ w@@ ades .
as you begin the point at the height of the recovery - the mystery of the mon@@ op@@ es of people to imagine a car@@ er with bro@@ dre@@ ni@@ ni@@ es - the mon@@ op@@ es of people to imagine a car@@ er with bro@@ dre@@ ni@@ ni@@ es , less strange than the green @-@ looking of 1950 , and now please a smile when I ask you on a few personal questions .
hom@@ able @-@ made to be found is a good way to close friend@@ ships .
their fellow citizens are committed to stand up , and will eventually be at the end of your face with a le@@ ck@@ king surprise .
whether you are a decent b@@ ter@@ cker .

steal is a common crime in the student of students .
of course , the K@@ anton of chicken is a theft , but it is the N@@ y@@ ry of a dr@@ er of Mill &apos;s book ?
check the da@@ da@@ est .
the odds are good that they say themselves to service themselves even if they are within the internal sphere .
if someone is wrong , you have a shame , and you have my sympathy - but try to use more than my fellow @-@ house fellow them to punish the same milk to punish the th@@ th@@ des .
it is now in prison .
they should not make a li@@ b , who is holding people from sleep or from the work .
not only is it merely about to be a decent man , but that you are in the literally sense of the law .
a girl on my fl@@ ur asked her neighbors if it is something to do what it is to ask , because it is three p@@ .@@ ch@@ t@@ ing , and she had a test for the morning .
responded to them responded with even more cens@@ ly music .
after all , when she heard her own music , she left their neighbors , and to test her own music , to sleep their neighbors , and to test their final test .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future adul@@ partners happens to enter the same student of the same student of the home ?
conversely , if you can join a fellow @-@ han@@ po@@ g in your future adul@@ arian , would it be deeply embarrassing to be drawn to them , and then must be seen and perhaps how they all of common friends can be over@@ pul@@ ling ?
of course , the heart of heart is about its own paths - but if a hot co @-@ election is definitely not your future marriage , you try at least try to talk your under@@ bel@@ b .

my project has housing .

I have a point of how to build today &apos;s lives and well .

thing are going to be the refugees ; we let the refugees get back ; we let the refugees be brought down ; we let the refugees be brought down ;
it is a clear @-@ headed .
the controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
still , it is clear that anyone who wants to issue a asylum @-@ settlement issue , and of course , can be done .
people &apos;s supply and security .
but it is clear that there are strong signals , and he said the ministerial ministers .
people must know that we do not accept vulnerable migration flows , including the most desperate - the country &apos;s most desperate border .
controlled is needed .
Croatia is a source of the issue ; Slovenia refuses to reject Slovenia .
the refugees had previously been told to Austria and Germany , and may also be able to build cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
this has happened to the Minister of Interior Minister V@@ es@@ na &apos;s Z@@ ni@@ na &apos;s Z@@ ni@@ na , but not to the sidelines .
the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is totally unacceptable ; Slovenia is intensify , and , above all , Hungary .
the border with Croatia is already heavily controlled .
as the ministerial minister pointed out , he wants to abandon his borders to refugees .
moreover , the EU &apos;s purpose of the EU is to be able to fulfill its commitments , but the system cannot work ; it emphasized the system &apos;s decision @-@ headed .
as the Cro@@ an government told , the first refugees had already tried to serve in the after@@ hours , in eastern Cro@@ ati@@ en on the border over the course of the death , in eastern Cro@@ ati@@ en on border @-@ T@@ w@@ .@@ T@@ .@@ <unk> / Si@@ d , to avoid the stage .

according to local media , the Cro@@ <unk> To@@ <unk> station @-@ based police vehicles have been engaged with new refugees .
it is mostly a Syrian and Afghans , among many women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in the use of the stakes .
in the coming days of view , the interior minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic said .
migrants &quot; had brought the day @-@ Hungarian border to Croatia , a Cro@@ ad and Serb media on the Arctic .
the government , however , denied that it is the people who are seeking to go to certain routine : neither can we , nor do we want to do so ; it was meant .
according to the media reports , more b@@ kes would be expected .

the in@@ occupation of the entire 500 kilometers away was the whole night of Serbia .
what we have been called is that Hungary has done , so the police said that we should go to the point ; &quot; he said of the refugees .
they wanted to travel by Croatia , Slovenia , and Austria .
indeed , it may now be the most Western Hungary to be Western @-@ minded Hungary .
Croatia : &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ;
Croatia &apos;s Minister minister of O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had to have emphasized that his country has prepared plans for the case of a strong influx of refugees to be prepared for possible exceptional situations .
details did not explain he , but he pointed out that Croatia was a non @-@ existent - the International Monetary Assistance - a member of the border , the main issue of the border .
consider strict controls to qualify for membership .
Slovenia is part of this since 2007 , the EU has provided a good illustration of what the standard of border controls is the price of border controls .
in the Serb side , behind the Hungarian border , the Hungarian border continues to be roughly 300 refugees .
according to media reports , they would have spent the past night on the border over the fall of dreams that are still spent after R@@ z@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border over@@ co@@ ding dreams and B@@ oul @-@ B@@ i &apos;s twin li@@ g remain utterly closed .
whether remaining refugees are to travel to the Cro@@ l border is not yet clear .
the Serbian minister of Ne@@ bo@@ j@@ sa St@@ y@@ y@@ c tried to calm down at a local eye shine in horror , and he is finding the debates about alternative routes from refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
big refugee would be not very large .
they cannot say whether they would continue their journey about Hungary , Croatia , or a different country .
aides to assist migrants - dangerous - alternative routes .
but private @-@ trained workers have already begun to distribute the refugees of land cards on which alternative routes are revealed by Croatia .
the end of Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border , there are still not a sub@@ mi@@ ed mining fields .
at the same time , the Cro@@ an police announced that a team of min@@ ers were sent in the border region .

in this way , the study &apos;s research was reported to be more than $ 100 million .
what is now is what today is saying that even those outside of our national borders are eventually captured , i.e. , the SEC is the task of the game .
the trials against 32 additional commitments were the case .
most of the defendants come from Ukraine and Georgia .

the lower prospect comes from the price increases , which will be 4.@@ 9 % on average , and , despite a higher amount of increases , the high @-@ cost price increases , which will be raised by November .
the company said that the result of the year , due to the cost of costs , higher revenues , and growth in the online - trade will increase trade .
the chairman and CEO of the CEO , said that the company would be able to do so ; a solid return would be considered as expected economic conditions , particularly in the first @-@ and @-@ trade environment .

on most expected meetings , Federal Reserve &apos;s presidents spend this week around a 27 @-@ kilometer - the world &apos;s most 27 @-@ page - de @-@ polar Honduras - Mahmoud Mah@@ ci@@ i - to decide whether it is time to decide whether it is time to raise the rate of the first rate for the first time for almost a decade .
the threat of the failure , two @-@ fan@@ vi@@ vi@@ ent customs of the state , is a different moment in the United States .
the map is a reminder that the Fed is turning to the task - the European leader of Jan@@ et L@@ et L@@ ern@@ es - and their colleagues to the commercial interests of the nation before all else .
the central bank has a double mandate of Congress : maximizing the US - employment and prices - is stable .
but , since the Great Recession , the Fed has recognized leaders that there are an unwritten third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X of X - a factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict it . it is the most famous that the US is being known , from the unprecedented incentive to be reconciled from the pre @-@ zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of economics show that they can grow solid , recent turmoil in global financial markets could make the already prudent Fed - the most recent financial markets make it anxious to reinforce these volatility by raising interest rates for federal bonds - and is just one @-@ quarter point .
the job market and inflation will be the most important thing they observe , said Lin@@ dse@@ y <unk> P@@ p@@ g@@ za , chief of the business company , and a new general in the business company .
to be sure , I think when they were looking at the search of a pretext not to raise the interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough for the global market to continue to stay on waiting for the global market .
there is no consensus about what the Fed will do , which is spreading to themselves .
this week , about half of the economists who recently been asked recently have predicted this week .
financial markets , however , expect a Fed wait to show a key indicator that is only a 30 % chance of an increase in the number of a 30 % chance .
this suggests a decline in the stock market , if the Fed increases the phrase that it is to promise that further increases is far from being .
on the Dow , the Dow Jones on 2@@ 2@@ 8.@@ 89 points , or around 1.4 % to 16@@ .@@ 5@@ 9@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action has caused expectations that the Fed has been asking - the politics of this week &apos;s policy in this week , said John London &apos;s chief economist at Moody &apos;s &quot; Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
it would be surprising if the Fed would raise rates at this point ; he said .
if it does , she would have to go very far in their Declaration to calm financial markets , lest them to panic .
other experts argued that the rate hike would calm financial markets , because it will eliminate uncertainty about when the Fed will act .
a month ago , the Fed seemed to be raising a good way to increase the phrase by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tightening of the monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ f had the spring and early summer that they were in the spring of the fact that more economic progress would be needed , despite the complaints of liberals that more economic progress would be needed to raise the price of the economy .
although job creation slowed in August , improving the labor market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate fell to 5.@@ 1 % last month , the lowest since more than seven years and near the Lev@@ ration that the Fed is at full employment .
increases in recovery have shown .
while inflation has been constantly going below the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the Fed has been asking - the Fed &apos;s reputation to support the temporary effect of the temporary oil prices .
the economy is going to be addressed , and it will require higher interest rates , and it is necessary for the labor market to be the labor market ; the chief economist in the Pan@@ the@@ on , the chief economist at the pan@@ the@@ on , said .
but financial markets , on the world , collapsed last month after China devalued its currency .
the Dow Jones average fell by more than 16 % in May , when investors feared that a slowdown in China &apos;s economy would slow global growth .
the market has something a bit this month , with the Dow now growing by almost 10 % below the H@@ oke .
for the Fed , the world &apos;s turmoil influence the complex calculations of when to raise interest rates .
in financial markets , and the news of the Chinese economy &apos;s weakness in the last few weeks , they would have been unable to keep the policy in this meeting , said , to the highest L@@ <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Center , the US Federal Reserve , the highest @-@ level @-@ of @-@ E@@ i@@ am Center for the real E@@ ter@@ an Center
now he says that it will wait at least a month to get the impact better .
there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US will be - the economy will be the economy , and there is almost no reliable data that is what developments in China are described ; said O@@ .
none of the main concern is the Fed , so it should not be involved .
but the Fed &apos;s monetary authority has become the world &apos;s monetary authority .

Brazilian &apos;s di@@ atri@@ c organization S@@ PR@@ S is trying to clarify women about how important nutrition during the grain @-@ time , and it does so with the presentation of images of babies who are at the mercy of unhealthy food .
Mo@@ o@@ ch is composed of a variety of proteins , flies , vit@@ am@@ ins , and carboh@@ y@@ d@@ rats , which they need to build the babies all nutrients that they need to build a strong immune system .
because of the additional energy , the more of the pregnant and young mothers are advised to raise their daily cal@@ ori@@ ation of imports by about 500 cal@@ ories a day .
but new research suggests that a higher cal@@ ori@@ al of export does not mean the only di@@ e@@ tic adjustment that should be done .
a recent study by Robert Water@@ land , professor of the Bav@@ <unk> land College of L@@ im Texas in Texas , showed that healthy nutrition of women actually affects the genes of their babies , and to protect them from developing tumors .

the plans for the long @-@ defined to@@ o @-@ building in the world &apos;s most modern @-@ style construction construction , the move for step forward , was created in the recent field , with the recent @-@ handed construction of the world &apos;s most recent post @-@ operation , without major discussions .
earlier , the panel was still a request for a single @-@ based legal system ; the exceptions for self @-@ fulfilling , self @-@ respectable , and the &quot; exception &quot; ; liberation on the board plan .
the exception for special representation was the exception for special design .
so , a &quot; No first , &quot; with no one @-@ sided , is built on the road ; the first @-@ time game with no problem is to be built .
backdrop of planning is the use of the umbrella for solar panels : D@@ ad@@ a , we get a wonderful Great south , and , in fact , the mayor , Joseph Joseph St@@ berger in the meeting .
in the process , liberation on the ground , which is , in turn , to be found for the reasons that are for the reasons - unlike the &quot; construction plan &quot; - is expected to be below ten degrees .
the volume of H@@ all is made clear .
a &quot; liberation &quot; was required , because the plant plan on the issue are not fixed , exceptions , and the government &apos;s core record , usually , is more restrictive .
but , at the crossroads of the Tur@@ o , there is no recurring project : we create no precedent , so it is a self @-@ defeating .
the To@@ n@@ que construction of the S@@ interior center is a community project of the community and the S@@ V .
at the expense of the costs , there are roughly 2.3 million euros .

the situation on the German housing market is tense .
refugees , too , are seeking for an affordable reward .
pressure on housing is growing .
the social construction challenge is facing a challenge .
distribu@@ ational conflicts on the German housing market have long begun .
with the coming displaced and labor @-@ seeking workers increasingly push for the EU , more people are now pushing for a market that has already over@@ paced many large cities .
compete to compete with low @-@ income citizens are the last paid .
to cover demand for affordable housing , would need to be built by 400,000 new units by 2020 .
as a result , a study in the Treaty &apos;s mandate comes to the issue .

indeed , her@@ mo@@ an &apos;s top @-@ rate is the best below 7 % , writing the researchers .
after the operation , the average per capita level of per capita level has declined from around 9 % to around 6 % .
in medical care , however , it remained stable at around 8 % .
but the better and thin control of control - as you reflect in the improved gra@@ od@@ ity of A@@ 1@@ c levels - reduced not the mortality in five years , including the top scientist Dr. Chi@@ h - Ch@@ Ch@@ eng - Ch@@ Ch@@ eng and his colleagues .

while the new study has no survival advantage of the Ch@@ ge@@ gy of the Ch@@ ge@@ gy of the past five years , there is evidence of a study of more than a more adult people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says the University of Arizona , college of P@@ ho@@ x .
in Sweden &apos;s study , it was in the most people who have been turning a A@@ di@@ sh of Japan - an operation , for example , 29 % less likely to die over 15 years - compared to a group that has tried more conventional methods .
although the new study does not benefit the survival of the ch@@ ge@@ gy of the ch@@ ge@@ gy , the patient said that it was reassuring for people with a B@@ M@@ I , under 35 , who are interested in the trial .
what is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation in this low B@@ M@@ I - the largest group is a lower group of death , without risking the death of death or a kidney disease , she said .
Blackstone the patient added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously once the patient is between 27 and 30 .
I think that we are too long waiting to get people to take this seriously , said they said .
I think that once they have given these genetic changes , which have linked their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a reversal is really difficult to be .

the Dalai Lama spoke of the problem of violence and , in the US , George Bush &apos;s actions after the September 11 attack , and it turned out that the violent response to the US has turned a chain of uncontrollable events .
after September 11 th , I have expressed my contribution to President Bush , and I said he to resolve the way to resolve this problem is in non @-@ violence .
I know that his motives were good , but he took violence , and that has unexpected consequences ; he said the Dalai Lama .

B@@ iter &apos;s idea has been the idea of the idea of tension football , attacked , and his mentor , remember that Ben@@ ter is dra@@ us@@ ly on the Premier League in 2010 , with the Premier League won the Premier League in 2010 .

that is the game game that you want to play if you want to play this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team , two players , such as Czech ony Mil@@ ford and Ben H@@ <unk> , so that they can play as they can play .
I build stronger trust because they say this things because they are a bit worry about playing to play .

our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts at our game , but is a real play ?

a man who might be smugg@@ led a life sentence because of his attempt to come from 40 kilograms of cocaine , which has been led to the Qu@@ e@@ land land , was a man of 200,000 $ released .
Mark@@ o , 29 , was one of the five men who arrested last month after the federal police took 100 kg of the drug on the Y@@ eight Sol@@ ay , which came from South America to V@@ j@@ at@@ u and August in a code in the Co@@ om@@ era .
indeed , unlike his fellow house , the captain was observed , as he had his fellow house , the television , and later in the caf@@ é Co@@ om@@ era Ro@@ ad@@ <unk> , where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota .
the lawyer of Finance Minister , despite a life of life , argued that it has no evidence that he tried to hold the whole amount and that in the caf@@ é could have been a benign cause .
the Supreme Court , Peter F@@ lan@@ y , was worried by the availability of the financial Court , in exchange rates .
he has clear relations with Serbia .

to be held on the police .
in fact , a $ 200,000 dollar had offered a $ 200,000 of the $ 200,000 to reach his release .
the two people &quot; L@@ ss are clearly aware of the L@@ an@@ man &apos;s be@@ in@@ est statements , it is clear that the cost of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden ; the judge said F@@ lan@@ an .
but this alone will not be enough to prevent it from not to appear to be deterred by it .

a P@@ urbani@@ op@@ er used a phone of a 11 @-@ year old girl to demand pictures of childhood .
@-@ to @-@ day &quot; s &quot; he was a series of un@@ steady images of children &apos;s girl .
the girl later opened up and discovered that the phone lacked and found in the hands of the sle@@ ice .
they saw it , and alarmed their mother immediately .
the police were concerned , and the five images , analy@@ zed , and discovered the way , and , to be sure , the Web and Web @-@ based Web Fund - the Web Fund - the Global Fund - the notion of the search for un@@ in@@ permanent images of children .
Ho@@ g , then , claimed that he had done it , because it would lead to the Internet , and then admitted to be a policeman to scare them .
the D@@ im Sh@@ eri@@ h Ro@@ ber@@ ts@@ on , the D@@ K@@ e Sh@@ eri@@ ff , said that he would be an addiction to the D@@ K@@ e Sh@@ eri@@ ff : he said that he is addictive , people too scare .
he admitted that the Su@@ ches were carried out by him , but said that he was , because he wanted to be a policeman to scare P@@ cities .
he was asked to his talking with the unknown person who sent him to him and asked him to send more photos .
he said he did so to attract them .
he said he was ill in mind when he is in@@ in@@ y , and he said that he wanted images of rape and murder .
M@@ S Ro@@ ber@@ z@@ on added : the girl found news on the telephone , she called her mother and was the le@@ le@@ am and on the back .
they then saw the in@@ sen@@ tuous pictures of the phone and the accused the defendants .
the girl was inter@@ fed and said that the defendants and Play@@ St@@ men used to speak with girls who saw much younger than he did .

defense &apos;s main role - the lawyer G@@ reg@@ or S@@ im asked that Ho@@ g@@ g was not in the most of the sexual criminal , because it could be argued that Ho@@ g@@ g cannot be found in the regi@@ ci@@ est criminal sentence , because it could be argued that no significant sexu@@ ist element is a factor in his crime .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff A@@ un@@ an , Sh@@ eri@@ ff Car@@ mi@@ an , remains to keep the judgment until October , to preserve the background of social services .

J@@ V@@ A Berlin - The T@@ ard : five square meters cell cell are un@@ un@@ ner@@ able .
the federal Constitutional Court has a former , the International Constitutional Court of a judicial system of justice , a house of the judicial system , a few @-@ month @-@ in @-@ a @-@ flying @-@ cell @-@ month @-@ month .
in the face of their human dignity , detainees are fundamentally entitled to financial compensation when they are in a small cells .
this has ruled the federal Constitutional Court in a seat .
the affected people can even hope for money if they were only a few days in the too few days ( a@@ z ) of 27 27 / 14 ) .
to succeed , a former , the head of his constitutional victory in Kar@@ l@@ s@@ de , was successfully in the judicial system : the judicial system of June and November 2009 , in a single @-@ tier cell , with roughly five square square square sites ; the to@@ i@@ te was not .
after the time , the man who has been re@@ ared after the party &apos;s claim was now being left to a large @-@ scale high ground in a larger cell .
his acts of his court for un@@ paid ill @-@ vis the country failed .
but the Constitutional judge , the Constitutional judge , raised the verdict of the Kam@@ le of the Berlin , and then had returned to the case to return .
they have been injured by the man &apos;s human dignity .
Kam@@ le court now decides the compensation of compensation .
for reasons , for reasons , for reasons of legal reasons , only a few days of liability for compensation is a discipline of the compensation that it meant .
otherwise , a misunderstanding of the law &apos;s legal protection would be .
the cameras of the gun must now be addressed .
the constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of criminal prisoners .
they just spoke in April an detainee of a detainee of a detainee , because he was imprisoned in a cell .
according to being un@@ un@@ born , a cell decision is that there are plenty of a cell without a separate to@@ let@@ te .

Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp;
refugees is a huge challenge - the German Chancellor determined to address them .
becomes to be turned to Germany ?
around 800 , asylum asylum is likely to come after the federal average Office forecasts this year , according by Deputy economist Vice @-@ Deputy Si@@ g@@ ler ( SPD ) , Germany is even capable of joining a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) , given the unusual challenge of resolve : I say and again again : we can do this , and we can create it .
we are taking on .
the different forecasts of the federal R@@ Office ( estimates of the federal R@@ Office ) and the 17@@ 0@@ th ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el - the P@@ est@@ el Institute - the P@@ est@@ el Institute - the P@@ est@@ el Institute - the next five years .
this is nearly twice as much as it is built ( 25@@ 0@@ 0,000 homes ) .
dramatically , the lack of housing and especially affordable mi@@ et@@ es are a year of the bottom line : a year of $ 60@@ 0,000 @-@ grade social homes in the mix of the mix , and these are particularly favorable housing for those particularly favorable housing .
the Minister of Justice , a major @-@ 18 million ( SPD ) , is therefore to double the production , from currently 5@@ 18 million to a billion euros .
too little is the point of the P@@ est@@ el - the International Institute : 80 @-@ of @-@ day of $ 6.@@ 4 billion per year would have to be investing .
in the broad , scientists and federal @-@ sector efforts are in fact that there must be more tax advantages for investment in housing .
according to the Institute of the Institute for labor market and professional research , it is assumed that 55 % of the dreaded in Germany will be in the short @-@ term .
but the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their skills to help them to help them , and Clau@@ dia , the project of integration , and education in Ber@@ ter@@ ony - the foundation of the Financial Security Council .
but the key to integration of refugees is whether it will find in Germany .
work is the key to social contacts , for which the value of the absor@@ bers , but also for the self @-@ esteem of migrants , tells the di@@ et@@ rich throne .
in Germany , there has been a political change in Germany : the authorities banned from labor to refugees to get work .
while it was used to ban asylum seekers from the five to five years , this November 2014 was reduced to three months , as well as the Re@@ c@@ cy of asylum seekers on a residential site .
in society , too , the view has been given that refugees will have more quickly to be allowed to labor access .
a major obstacle to the labor market is a lack of under@@ service .
so far , there is no supply supply of general and professional @-@ related language .
research also shows that jobs are most often mediated by personal contacts .
the building of networks is therefore a view of the royal path to work integration .
the Berlin School of the Berlin administration found that few people have been able to give their children into the S@@ an@@ as , an estimated 10 @-@ 15 % : the next @-@ guard parents are not yet to hold the family , says , and , indeed , the family , says , and , indeed , the family , says , says , says , says , and , indeed , the family , says , says
yet to convince the family , the administration is distributed in different languages .
if the need to attract the workforce of the workforce by the large number of refugees is rising , the Berlin Senate would seek to increase educational capacity - for example , by allowing more skilled schools .
in countries , students are prepared for the education without a lack of their under@@ @-@ house students .
but they are not taught by fully educated teachers and teachers , but , as in Berlin , the teachers who have only a single @-@ quality background as a second language .
there is no shortage of any shortage , says Be@@ zz@@ als of the Berlin school .
the German student works estimates that about 20 % of refugees want to study in Germany .
in principle , no state of asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception has been the Berlin , interior , Frank Hen@@ cle ( CDU ) , but has now abandoned his position .
studies of refugees could be made easier to pay .
for refugees with an entry of return or tolerance , there is no achievements in the asylum @-@ seekers bill when they begin an study .
the latter is not a b@@ af@@ gue , because they are not going to be in the hands of the people .
displaced refugees had to have lived in Germany four years in Germany to be a be@@ af@@ g of the Americas - the right to be justified from January 1 , 2016 .
this financing gap also needs to be closed , but they call for St@@ ch , Ber@@ l@@ s State secretary for science , and the Germans of student .
should be quick to bear .
Islam will be a more important role in determining a more important role , because many refugees are Muslims , and many are important to many , and for many reasons to be important part of their identity .
the state should put to Islam , and the existing state - desperate churches - is pressing to a new state - the country &apos;s right to develop - and the existing state - to create a new state - to create the country &apos;s religions .
it is important to the establishment of an Islamic welfare group that does be professional to newcomers .
the rights belong to the right .
so representatives of Islam must be on clear requests between some and willing to work with the state in many areas and give him some control .
this includes a willingness to crack boldly against religious fundamentalism .
the head of the Muslims &apos;s Central council , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ z@@ z@@ k , expressed the concern that religious conflicts could be taken after Germany .
those who wanted to carry out such conflicts in Germany , immediately have their right to be said in Germany , and , in the case , he said in Germany &apos;s Bav@@ ri@@ k .
he proposed to over@@ ride the Basic Law .
integration will be a subject to society .
this will require the majority society , and racism is more pressing .
the outcome of European decisions - as a result of European decisions - has a anti @-@ discrimination and general equal @-@ enforcement law .
but it is very slow , as the N@@ S@@ U cause - the N@@ S@@ U - to show the racist motive , in the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive .
the same is true , the same opportunities for everyone : what migrant organizations and interest groups of non @-@ racial Germany commit to Germany , and why international agreements such as the anti @-@ racial Convention on Germany will have to become reality in the next few years if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens to use their opportunities - for the sake of all .
the general effect is that Germany is able to provide medical medical holders so far as the most expected refugees , says as medical Frank , Ul@@ rich , suicidal .
what is needed is what is needed to do so ; the day mirror it is .
but the money is needed to flow into the system .
to avoid bottlenecks , he calls for a &quot; seeking to protect all every aspect of the type of health cards .
services could be expected later with the federal countries .
and , in the long run , it is highly doubtful to dismiss the limited performance of services that the asylum @-@ market bill is un@@ regarded .
otherwise , doctors , make the language of the language of the language .
so far , the Berlin &apos;s health @-@ care scientific philosophy has been more than other patients .
not only clinics , including medical practice , would have to be taken on a discount for drugs , including the costs of the medical bill .
but many refugees would already be able to get out of the emergency results with more general medical channels .
and with another diagnostic view .
there are much more un@@ volatile , and the youth is concerned about HIV - the culprit , in the youth - is a much more un@@ restrained of the un@@ sc@@ ber of the young .
, with some other of the training .
the refugees is not so difficult to identify and tuberculosis , and what is concerned for the medical care is not so difficult to see , and what is concerned for the medical zone is even more likely to be relieved .
the Syrians would have a advanced educational system , many refugees are even physicians .
but they need to show their skills and may be put aside .
at least half of the refugees coming in Germany to be ill @-@ sized , the federal psycho@@ tor E@@ e@@ K is mentally ill : most suffer from post @-@ traumatic stress disorder or depression .
the most vulnerable @-@ headed of the B@@ P@@ K are particularly vulnerable .
a recent study by the T@@ Munich
those who have a post @-@ traumatic record disorder is suffering , including so @-@ called fish with the breath , cheating , heart , and death .
other symptoms are sleep and concentration disorder , strong di@@ ness , and emotional do@@ dity .
to prevent the symptoms that the symptoms would be chronically , it said , in turn .
for the mentally ill of the mentally ill are .
while the people of the most vulnerable asylum @-@ seekers uses to be a request for psycho@@ therapy , the story is typically several months .
whether , in the social classes , in social individuals , there would be a general number of workers or physicians who are not trained for mental illness , whether or not .
result is often attributed to miscalculation .

he emphasized that it was only September , and if his rehabilitation is in the case of plan , there is no reason why he cannot play a way before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario is already meant that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will be at least the next four games for England , and , given its involvement in the next summer , his involvement in the European Union will certainly be uncertain .
the great shame in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had had a strong end in the last season after a separate K@@ im@@ s@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ ke@@ er , and then had to re @-@ engineer its old momentum during the pre @-@ season season .
in fact , the kind of injury does not threaten the career , said little .

that is no longer a bigger affair .
we accident was only a accident .
it was not connected to its c@@ ssi@@ ms or injuries he had previously .
this may be true of purely medical perspective , but , as few as it has also acknowledged , there is a risk of further injury , whenever a player tried to return to the middle season .
it is also a uncomfortable pattern .
the study of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ k L@@ t@@ d &apos;s investigation of the Wil@@ sh@@ er &apos;s , 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his De@@ ves , have been six years ago .
it also played in just 65 of the arsenal in just 65 of the arsenal in the past five months .
the broader picture for the arsenal is that it had six from eight periods in 2007 @-@ 08 , with the two Premier League , which have seen most vulnerability @-@ up .
few have accepted the potential of a vicious circle , but it is worth that improvement in the rate of vulnerability over the last season will continue .

I hope that his body is stabilized , I am confident that he will do it and he will be a career of the way he deserves .

in 2013 , it was the most important death of death in men at the age of 20 to 45 in the UK , and three times more frequently in men than women .
in an effort to address the problem , the C@@ amp@@ ai@@ <unk> ( CA@@ L@@ M - campaign to a nasty life of 2015 , the man of 2015 , announced the man &apos;s goal of seeking help from helping help if they need them .
friendship is the heart in the struggle to master this challenge .

for those who are not depressed , a circle of mental @-@ healthy friends hal@@ fies the risks of mental problems .
but , of course , one must have even friends to work with a friendship .
in the age of the social media communications , with its emphasis on substance , the answer often is more central than a significant one .
our digital lives have the need to appear strong , and successful , even if isolation dominates isolation .
the most superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call to call for what psychologists are ex@@ in@@ aire . money , image , social status , all at the expense of values , and friendship that affects much deeper health .
and , like a video match - invent@@ ors and billionaire ) declared that money cannot buy happiness .
the beauty of the scene was that this focus was put on head .
each character was defined not through his work , but by his personality that the interaction as a friend has been a friend .
the hum@@ or of Jo@@ ey and C@@ hand@@ ler of Jo@@ ey and C@@ hand@@ ler of frequent Um@@ gs , moments of football fans , and the yearning of Ross after revenge - all this came from the knowledge that men can count on whatever , even if they often hold themselves to explore their feelings .
as one of the telephone @-@ looking to me said : ... I am ... my audience for people who feel depressed and en@@ en@@ en@@ at risk , and I really showed how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference .
the men who are planning feel unable to speak with friends .
the old slogan of the problems is perceived as I is right .

Ham@@ mer artists spent three years in the personal interpretation of Bi@@ ble .
Jesus with the ( ver@@ ed ) village one is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar A@@ les for his Bi@@ ble has been made .

it was in cycles that are exposed to the sidelines , such as the cross@@ way , p@@ ats , or our address .
this has been fascinated by several partners : the culprit of the White tion - the responsibility of his theological orientation , as well as for the plaintiffs , was his focus on art books .
and , for all , the author of Klaus Al@@ te@@ post , who has been divided on the Mal@@ esy with the host of the Mal@@ esy .
he has interpreted Bi@@ mar A@@ les , and so forth in current contexts .
these texts are like verbal mirror of Al@@ ch@@ Mal@@ esy .

the smuggling band has a golden lit@@ et@@ .
as a result , the 75 @-@ off spread of the 75 - the E@@ ok@@ ing is twice a deep glimpse in his soul , his emotions .
this is a high level of insu@@ ity .
emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bi@@ ble - the E@@ qui@@ et : Ot@@ mar A@@ les , 1940 in a b@@ ris@@ tu@@ ry , and in Berlin , comes from a family that has been the strict Protestant , the strict Protestant , the strict Protestant , the strict Protestant , the strict Protestant , the strict Protestant , the strict Protestant , the strict Protestant , the strict Protestant , the strict Protestant , the

D@@ ob@@ rin@@ dt , on the verge of the automobile &apos;s C@@ et@@ ary , spoke of a &quot; red &quot; of the automobile &apos;s ro@@ bi@@ ary , a new Mo@@ bi@@ es@@ t .
the automated and interconnected drivers would increase traffic safety and make a smaller amount of ensuring , said D@@ ob@@ rin@@ dt .
he wants to discuss the issue with its counterparts from the G @-@ 7 - the states of the United States , which included industry on the IA@@ A .
the transport Ministry &apos;s policy @-@ opening general prohibition has been emphasized in the importance of the mobile broad@@ band of the traffic Ministry - the persistence of the construction and rapid shift in digital H@@ an@@ ins .
testing new technology is now headed in Bav@@ arians .
as a result , the federal government wants the legal framework to be collected ; review and , where necessary to adapt to new developments .
for example , Germany wants internationally to use the need for a sudden @-@ handed car to be raised by 10 to 130 .
the federal government also wants to change the Vienna agreement to use only the people as a driver .
as automated @-@ phone breaks increasingly takes , the car will become more and more to passengers .

according to an study , high @-@ automatic drivers will be possible at the same time by 2020 .
nevertheless , the road of the road to public roads is now being fixed ; only after 2020 .
the value @-@ added of the driver &apos;s car systems and highly automatic vehicle functions in the location is the authors of the World 2025 estimated to estimate about $ 8.@@ 4 billion .

the question of liability , and the security of the personal information &apos;s data , must be resolved .
but the Germans still view themselves skeptical - much more than French or Americans .
the Human Rights Committee , the task of For@@ sa , is the result that only eight % of Germans will believe that only eight % of Germans will believe that the country &apos;s wealth @-@ resistant car will prevail in the coming decade , 32 % don &apos;t believe that they are not going to see 31 % .

in Germany , the drivers of Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ defeating vehicle .
after a survey of the rise , only seven % agree to agree to control control throughout the streets .

Xi is pushing to open the economy more widely to the world .
the economy must open broader outward to growth , said President Xi Jinping has a group that was charged with the governance of reform .
in addition , China should use its foreign investment and know of know - and to encourage the policies for business initiatives ; , in a view , he said in a commitment at the 16th meeting of the Central leadership group for a comprehensive reform .
new momentum and reform will spur new momentum and vitality and push forward to economic growth , said Xi .
the leadership group has adopted a series of guidelines , including a negative list of market access , the mandate of border controls - the Strategy of the state to absorb private capital ( the National E ) , to absorb private capital , and the source of people - the International Mel@@ T@@ system .
after the statute , a negative list will be based on a negative list of the sectors and businesses that are not identified for investment .
the system will be tested and improved for tested and through testing programs .
the initiative is important because it provides a greater role in allocation of resources , a legal state environment , and making the market more open , said the statute .
the government will also loosen controls on companies and make sure that companies choose how to run their business .
the statute also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
in a supply of supply , state @-@ controlled sectors , more areas of private investment will be opened .
moreover , the government will not change its policies toward foreign investment , and will protect the legitimate interests of leveraged companies and provide better services to them ; they said the statute .
moreover , it will be easier for foreigners to be a permanent residence or the &quot; Green C@@ ard &quot; ; green C@@ ard , the demands of the process , by making the demands and the job process easier .

according to the point , the nerve &apos;s limits on the nerve &apos;s limits should be raised by the nerve toxic to large fish at the end of the food chain , such as Haider or swi@@ p@@ fi@@ sch , and , by one of two months of mercury mercury , from one of the same low @-@ ever @-@ day items of mercury .
but great pred@@ ators are so highly correlated with mercury that , for example , 50 % of the F@@ bers are not sold .
after doubling the limits , only 1@@ 4.5 % un@@ o@@ o@@ o@@ o@@ o@@ o@@ ble .

mercury is a high @-@ toxic severity for the people of the food chain , particularly in a wild fish .
the federal government therefore warns that it is already to be a &quot; nervous system &quot; of small amounts of the nervous system .
the Federal Environment of Economics explains on its hom@@ ep@@ age with respect to the high level , but that a &quot; no health threat to the general population is the general population .
mercury is mainly caused by coal im@@ im@@ we@@ ality .
